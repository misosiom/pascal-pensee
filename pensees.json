    "text": "The difference between the mathematical and the intuitive mind.[1]—In\nthe one the principles are palpable, but removed from ordinary\nuse; so that for want of habit it is difficult to turn one's mind\nin that direction: but if one turns it thither ever so little, one\nsees the principles fully, and one must have a quite inaccurate\nmind who reasons wrongly from principles so plain that it is\nalmost impossible they should escape notice.But in the intuitive mind the principles are found in common\nuse, and are before the eyes of everybody. One has only to\nlook, and no effort is necessary; it is only a question of good\neyesight, but it must be good, for the principles are so subtle\nand so numerous, that it is almost impossible but that some\nescape notice. Now the omission of one principle leads to\nerror; thus one must have very clear sight to see all the principles,\nand in the next place an accurate mind not to draw false\ndeductions from known principles.All mathematicians would then be intuitive if they had clear\nsight, for they do not reason incorrectly from principles known\nto them; and intuitive minds would be mathematical if they\ncould turn their eyes to the principles of mathematics to which\nthey are unused.The reason, therefore, that some intuitive minds are not\nmathematical is that they cannot at all turn their attention\nto the principles of mathematics. But the reason that mathematicians\nare not intuitive is that they do not see what is\nbefore them, and that, accustomed to the exact and plain principles\nof mathematics, and not reasoning till they have well\ninspected and arranged their principles, they are lost in matters\nof intuition where the principles do not allow of such arrangement.\nThey are scarcely seen; they are felt rather than seen;\nthere is the greatest difficulty in making them felt by those[Pg 2]who do not of themselves perceive them. These principles are\nso fine and so numerous that a very delicate and very clear\nsense is needed to perceive them, and to judge rightly and\njustly when they are perceived, without for the most part being\nable to demonstrate them in order as in mathematics; because\nthe principles are not known to us in the same way, and because\nit would be an endless matter to undertake it. We must see\nthe matter at once, at one glance, and not by a process of\nreasoning, at least to a certain degree. And thus it is rare that\nmathematicians are intuitive, and that men of intuition are\nmathematicians, because mathematicians wish to treat matters\nof intuition mathematically, and make themselves ridiculous,\nwishing to begin with definitions and then with axioms, which\nis not the way to proceed in this kind of reasoning. Not that\nthe mind does not do so, but it does it tacitly, naturally, and\nwithout technical rules; for the expression of it is beyond all\nmen, and only a few can feel it.Intuitive minds, on the contrary, being thus accustomed to\njudge at a single glance, are so astonished when they are presented\nwith propositions of which they understand nothing,\nand the way to which is through definitions and axioms so\nsterile, and which they are not accustomed to see thus in detail,\nthat they are repelled and disheartened.But dull minds are never either intuitive or mathematical.Mathematicians who are only mathematicians have exact\nminds, provided all things are explained to them by means of\ndefinitions and axioms; otherwise they are inaccurate and\ninsufferable, for they are only right when the principles are\nquite clear.And men of intuition who are only intuitive cannot have\nthe patience to reach to first principles of things speculative\nand conceptual, which they have never seen in the world, and\nwhich are altogether out of the common."

If it be not true, there is no truth in man; and if it be\ntrue, he finds therein great cause for humiliation, being compelled\nto abase himself in one way or another. And since he\ncannot exist without this knowledge, I wish that, before entering\non deeper researches into nature, he would consider her both\nseriously and at leisure, that he would reflect upon himself also,\nand knowing what proportion there is ...] Let man then\ncontemplate the whole of nature in her full and grand majesty,\nand turn his vision from the low objects which surround him.\nLet him gaze on that brilliant light, set like an eternal lamp to\nillumine the universe; let the earth appear to him a point in\ncomparison with the vast circle described by the sun; and let\nhim wonder at the fact that this vast circle is itself but a very\nfine point in comparison with that described by the stars in their\nrevolution round the firmament. But if our view be arrested\nthere, let our imagination pass beyond; it will sooner exhaust\nthe power of conception than nature that of supplying material\nfor conception. The whole visible world is only an imperceptible\natom in the ample bosom of nature. No idea approaches\nit. We may enlarge our conceptions beyond all imaginable\nspace; we only produce atoms in comparison with the reality of\nthings. It is an infinite sphere, the centre of which is everywhere,\nthe circumference nowhere.[30]In short it is the greatest\nsensible mark of the almighty power of God, that imagination\nloses itself in that thought.[Pg 17]Returning to himself, let man consider what he is in comparison\nwith all existence; let him regard himself as lost in this\nremote corner of nature; and from the little cell in which he\nfinds himself lodged, I mean the universe, let him estimate at\ntheir true value the earth, kingdoms, cities, and himself. What\nis a man in the Infinite?But to show him another prodigy equally astonishing, let\nhim examine the most delicate things he knows. Let a mite\nbe given him, with its minute body and parts incomparably\nmore minute, limbs with their joints, veins in the limbs, blood\nin the veins, humours in the blood, drops in the humours,\nvapours in the drops. Dividing these last things again, let\nhim exhaust his powers of conception, and let the last object at\nwhich he can arrive be now that of our discourse. Perhaps he\nwill think that here is the smallest point in nature. I will let\nhim see therein a new abyss. I will paint for him not only the\nvisible universe, but all that he can conceive of nature's immensity\nin the womb of this abridged atom. Let him see\ntherein an infinity of universes, each of which has its firmament,\nits planets, its earth, in the same proportion as in the visible\nworld; in each earth animals, and in the last mites, in which he\nwill find again all that the first had, finding still in these others\nthe same thing without end and without cessation. Let him\nlose himself in wonders as amazing in their littleness as the\nothers in their vastness. For who will not be astounded at the\nfact that our body, which a little while ago was imperceptible in\nthe universe, itself imperceptible in the bosom of the whole, is\nnow a colossus, a world, or rather a whole, in respect of the\nnothingness which we cannot reach? He who regards himself\nin this light will be afraid of himself, and observing himself\nsustained in the body given him by nature between those\ntwo abysses of the Infinite and Nothing, will tremble at\nthe sight of these marvels; and I think that, as his\ncuriosity changes into admiration, he will be more disposed\nto contemplate them in silence than to examine them with\npresumption.For in fact what is man in nature? A Nothing in comparison\nwith the Infinite, an All in comparison with the Nothing, a\nmean between nothing and everything. Since he is infinitely\nremoved from comprehending the extremes, the end of things\nand their beginning are hopelessly hidden from him in an\nimpenetrable secret, he is equally incapable of seeing the[Pg 18]Nothing from which he was made, and the Infinite in which he\nis swallowed up.What will he do then, but perceive the appearance of the\nmiddle of things, in an eternal despair of knowing either their\nbeginning or their end. All things proceed from the Nothing,\nand are borne towards the Infinite. Who will follow these\nmarvellous processes? The Author of these wonders understands\nthem. None other can do so.Through failure to contemplate these Infinites, men have\nrashly rushed into the examination of nature, as though they\nbore some proportion to her. It is strange that they have\nwished to understand the beginnings of things, and thence to\narrive at the knowledge of the whole, with a presumption as\ninfinite as their object. For surely this design cannot be\nformed without presumption or without a capacity infinite\nlike nature.If we are well informed, we understand that, as nature has\ngraven her image and that of her Author on all things, they\nalmost all partake of her double infinity. Thus we see that all\nthe sciences are infinite in the extent of their researches. For\nwho doubts that geometry, for instance, has an infinite infinity\nof problems to solve? They are also infinite in the multitude\nand fineness of their premises; for it is clear that those which are\nput forward as ultimate are not self-supporting, but are based\non others which, again having others for their support, do\nnot permit of finality. But we represent some as ultimate for\nreason, in the same way as in regard to material objects we\ncall that an indivisible point beyond which our senses can no\nlonger perceive anything, although by its nature it is infinitely\ndivisible.Of these two Infinites of science, that of greatness is the most\npalpable, and hence a few persons have pretended to know all\nthings. \"I will speak of the whole,\"[31]said Democritus.But the infinitely little is the least obvious. Philosophers\nhave much oftener claimed to have reached it, and it is here\nthey have all stumbled. This has given rise to such common\ntitles asFirst Principles,Principles of Philosophy,[32]and the like,\nas ostentatious in fact, though not in appearance, as that one\nwhich blinds us,De omni scibili.[33]We naturally believe ourselves far more capable of reaching\nthe centre of things than of embracing their circumference.\nThe visible extent of the world visibly exceeds us; but as we[Pg 19]exceed little things, we think ourselves more capable of knowing\nthem. And yet we need no less capacity for attaining the\nNothing than the All. Infinite capacity is required for both,\nand it seems to me that whoever shall have understood the\nultimate principles of being might also attain to the knowledge\nof the Infinite. The one depends on the other, and one leads\nto the other. These extremes meet and reunite by force of\ndistance, and find each other in God, and in God alone.Let us then take our compass; we are something, and we are\nnot everything. The nature of our existence hides from us\nthe knowledge of first beginnings which are born of the Nothing;\nand the littleness of our being conceals from us the sight of\nthe Infinite.Our intellect holds the same position in the world of thought\nas our body occupies in the expanse of nature.Limited as we are in every way, this state which holds the\nmean between two extremes is present in all our impotence.\nOur senses perceive no extreme. Too much sound deafens us;\ntoo much light dazzles us; too great distance or proximity\nhinders our view. Too great length and too great brevity of\ndiscourse tend to obscurity; too much truth is paralysing (I\nknow some who cannot understand that to take four from\nnothing leaves nothing). First principles are too self-evident\nfor us; too much pleasure disagrees with us. Too many concords\nare annoying in music; too many benefits irritate us; we wish\nto have the wherewithal to over-pay our debts.Beneficia eo\nusque læta sunt dum videntur exsolvi posse; ubi multum antevenere,\npro gratia odium redditur.[34]We feel neither extreme heat nor\nextreme cold. Excessive qualities are prejudicial to us and not\nperceptible by the senses; we do not feel but suffer them.\nExtreme youth and extreme age hinder the mind, as also too\nmuch and too little education. In short, extremes are for us\nas though they were not, and we are not within their notice.\nThey escape us, or we them.This is our true state; this is what makes us incapable of\ncertain knowledge and of absolute ignorance. We sail within\na vast sphere, ever drifting in uncertainty, driven from end to\nend. When we think to attach ourselves to any point and to\nfasten to it, it wavers and leaves us; and if we follow it, it\neludes our grasp, slips past us, and vanishes for ever. Nothing\nstays for us. This is our natural condition, and yet most\ncontrary to our inclination; we burn with desire to find solid[Pg 20]ground and an ultimate sure foundation whereon to build a\ntower reaching to the Infinite. But our whole groundwork\ncracks, and the earth opens to abysses.Let us therefore not look for certainty and stability. Our\nreason is always deceived by fickle shadows; nothing can fix\nthe finite between the two Infinites, which both enclose and\nfly from it.If this be well understood, I think that we shall remain at\nrest, each in the state wherein nature has placed him. As this\nsphere which has fallen to us as our lot is always distant from\neither extreme, what matters it that man should have a little\nmore knowledge of the universe? If he has it, he but gets a\nlittle higher. Is he not always infinitely removed from the\nend, and is not the duration of our life equally removed from\neternity, even if it lasts ten years longer?In comparison with these Infinites all finites are equal, and\nI see no reason for fixing our imagination on one more than\non another. The only comparison which we make of ourselves\nto the finite is painful to us.If man made himself the first object of study, he would see\nhow incapable he is of going further. How can a part know\nthe whole? But he may perhaps aspire to know at least the\nparts to which he bears some proportion. But the parts of the\nworld are all so related and linked to one another, that I believe it\nimpossible to know one without the other and without the whole.Man, for instance, is related to all he knows. He needs a\nplace wherein to abide, time through which to live, motion in\norder to live, elements to compose him, warmth and food to\nnourish him, air to breathe. He sees light; he feels bodies;\nin short, he is in a dependent alliance with everything. To\nknow man, then, it is necessary to know how it happens that\nhe needs air to live, and, to know the air, we must know how\nit is thus related to the life of man, etc. Flame cannot exist\nwithout air; therefore to understand the one, we must understand\nthe other.Since everything then is cause and effect, dependent and\nsupporting, mediate and immediate, and all is held together by\na natural though imperceptible chain, which binds together\nthings most distant and most different, I hold it equally impossible\nto know the parts without knowing the whole, and to\nknow the whole without knowing the parts in detail.[The eternity of things in itself or in God must also astonish[Pg 21]our brief duration. The fixed and constant immobility of\nnature, in comparison with the continual change which goes on\nwithin us, must have the same effect.]And what completes our incapability of knowing things, is\nthe fact that they are simple, and that we are composed of two\nopposite natures, different in kind, soul and body. For it is\nimpossible that our rational part should be other than spiritual;\nand if any one maintain that we are simply corporeal, this\nwould far more exclude us from the knowledge of things, there\nbeing nothing so inconceivable as to say that matter knows\nitself. It is impossible to imagine how it should know itself.So if we are simply material, we can know nothing at all;\nand if we are composed of mind and matter, we cannot know\nperfectly things which are simple, whether spiritual or corporeal.\nHence it comes that almost all philosophers have confused ideas\nof things, and speak of material things in spiritual terms, and\nof spiritual things in material terms. For they say boldly that\nbodies have a tendency to fall, that they seek after their centre,\nthat they fly from destruction, that they fear the void, that they\nhave inclinations, sympathies, antipathies, all of which attributes\npertain only to mind. And in speaking of minds, they\nconsider them as in a place, and attribute to them movement\nfrom one place to another; and these are qualities which belong\nonly to bodies.Instead of receiving the ideas of these things in their purity,\nwe colour them with our own qualities, and stamp with our composite\nbeing all the simple things which we contemplate.Who would not think, seeing us compose all things of mind\nand body, but that this mixture would be quite intelligible to\nus? Yet it is the very thing we least understand. Man is\nto himself the most wonderful object in nature; for he cannot\nconceive what the body is, still less what the mind is, and\nleast of all how a body should be united to a mind. This is\nthe consummation of his difficulties, and yet it is his very\nbeing.Modus quo corporibus adhærent spiritus comprehendi ab\nhominibus non potest, et hoc tamen homo est.[35]Finally, to complete\nthe proof of our weakness, I shall conclude with these\ntwo considerations...."

But being most generally false, she\ngives no sign of her nature, impressing the same character on\nthe true and the false.I do not speak of fools, I speak of the wisest men; and it is\namong them that the imagination has the great gift of persuasion.\nReason protests in vain; it cannot set a true value on things.This arrogant power, the enemy of reason, who likes to rule\nand dominate it, has established in man a second nature to show\nhow all-powerful she is. She makes men happy and sad, healthy\nand sick, rich and poor; she compels reason to believe, doubt,\nand deny; she blunts the senses, or quickens them; she has her\nfools and sages; and nothing vexes us more than to see that she\nfills her devotees with a satisfaction far more full and entire than\ndoes reason. Those who have a lively imagination are a great\ndeal more pleased with themselves than the wise can reasonably\nbe. They look down upon men with haughtiness; they argue\nwith boldness and confidence, others with fear and diffidence;\nand this gaiety of countenance often gives them the advantage\nin the opinion of the hearers, such favour have the imaginary\nwise in the eyes of judges of like nature. Imagination cannot\nmake fools wise; but she can make them happy, to the envy of\nreason which can only make its friends miserable; the one covers\nthem with glory, the other with shame.What but this faculty of imagination dispenses reputation,[Pg 25]awards respect and veneration to persons, works, laws, and the\ngreat? How insufficient are all the riches of the earth without\nher consent!Would you not say that this magistrate, whose venerable age\ncommands the respect of a whole people, is governed by pure\nand lofty reason, and that he judges causes according to their\ntrue nature without considering those mere trifles which only\naffect the imagination of the weak? See him go to sermon, full\nof devout zeal, strengthening his reason with the ardour of his\nlove. He is ready to listen with exemplary respect. Let the\npreacher appear, and let nature have given him a hoarse voice\nor a comical cast of countenance, or let his barber have given\nhim a bad shave, or let by chance his dress be more dirtied than\nusual, then however great the truths he announces. I wager our\nsenator loses his gravity.If the greatest philosopher in the world find himself upon a\nplank wider than actually necessary, but hanging over a precipice,\nhis imagination will prevail, though his reason convince\nhim of his safety.[49]Many cannot bear the thought without a\ncold sweat. I will not state all its effects.Every one knows that the sight of cats or rats, the crushing\nof a coal, etc. may unhinge the reason. The tone of voice\naffects the wisest, and changes the force of a discourse or a poem.Love or hate alters the aspect of justice. How much greater\nconfidence has an advocate, retained with a large fee, in the\njustice of his cause! How much better does his bold manner\nmake his case appear to the judges, deceived as they are by\nappearances! How ludicrous is reason, blown with a breath in\nevery direction!I should have to enumerate almost every action of men who\nscarce waver save under her assaults. For reason has been\nobliged to yield, and the wisest reason takes as her own principles\nthose which the imagination of man has everywhere rashly\nintroduced. [He who would follow reason only would be deemed\nfoolish by the generality of men. We must judge by the\nopinion of the majority of mankind. Because it has pleased\nthem, we must work all day for pleasures seen to be imaginary;\nand after sleep has refreshed our tired reason, we must forthwith\nstart up and rush after phantoms, and suffer the impressions\nof this mistress of the world. This is one of the sources of error,\nbut it is not the only one.]Our magistrates have known well this mystery. Their red[Pg 26]robes, the ermine in which they wrap themselves like furry cats,[50]the courts in which they administer justice, thefleurs-de-lis, and\nall such august apparel were necessary; if the physicians had\nnot their cassocks and their mules, if the doctors had not their\nsquare caps and their robes four times too wide, they would\nnever have duped the world, which cannot resist so original an\nappearance. If magistrates had true justice, and if physicians\nhad the true art of healing, they would have no occasion for\nsquare caps; the majesty of these sciences would of itself be\nvenerable enough. But having only imaginary knowledge,\nthey must employ those silly tools that strike the imagination\nwith which they have to deal; and thereby in fact they inspire\nrespect. Soldiers alone are not disguised in this manner,\nbecause indeed their part is the most essential; they establish\nthemselves by force, the others by show.Therefore our kings seek out no disguises. They do not\nmask themselves in extraordinary costumes to appear such;\nbut they are accompanied by guards and halberdiers. Those\narmed and red-faced puppets who have hands and power for\nthem alone, those trumpets and drums which go before them,\nand those legions round about them, make the stoutest tremble.\nThey have not dress only, they have might. A very refined\nreason is required to regard as an ordinary man the Grand\nTurk, in his superb seraglio, surrounded by forty thousand\njanissaries.We cannot even see an advocate in his robe and with his\ncap on his head, without a favourable opinion of his ability.\nThe imagination disposes of everything; it makes beauty,\njustice, and happiness, which is everything in the world. I\nshould much like to see an Italian work, of which I only know\nthe title, which alone is worth many books,Della opinione\nregina del mondo.[51]I approve of the book without knowing it,\nsave the evil in it, if any. These are pretty much the effects of\nthat deceptive faculty, which seems to have been expressly\ngiven us to lead us into necessary error. We have, however,\nmany other sources of error.Not only are old impressions capable of misleading us; the\ncharms of novelty have the same power. Hence arise all the\ndisputes of men, who taunt each other either with following\nthe false impressions of childhood or with running rashly after\nthe new. Who keeps the due mean? Let him appear and\nprove it. There is no principle, however natural to us from[Pg 27]infancy, which may not be made to pass for a false impression\neither of education or of sense.\"Because,\" say some, \"you have believed from childhood\nthat a box was empty when you saw nothing in it, you have\nbelieved in the possibility of a vacuum. This is an illusion of\nyour senses, strengthened by custom, which science must\ncorrect.\" \"Because,\" say others, \"you have been taught at\nschool that there is no vacuum, you have perverted your common\nsense which clearly comprehended it, and you must correct\nthis by returning to your first state.\" Which has deceived you,\nyour senses or your education?We have another source of error in diseases.[52]They spoil\nthe judgment and the senses; and if the more serious produce\na sensible change, I do not doubt that slighter ills produce a\nproportionate impression.Our own interest is again a marvellous instrument for nicely\nputting out our eyes. The justest man in the world is not\nallowed to be judge in his own cause; I know some who, in order\nnot to fall into this self-love, have been perfectly unjust out of\nopposition. The sure way of losing a just cause has been to\nget it recommended to these men by their near relatives.Justice and truth are two such subtle points, that our tools\nare too blunt to touch them accurately. If they reach the\npoint, they either crush it, or lean all round, more on the\nfalse than on the true.[Man is so happily formed that he has no ... good of the\ntrue, and several excellent of the false. Let us now see how\nmuch ... But the most powerful cause of error is the war\nexisting between the senses and reason.]"

But what will man do?\nHe cannot prevent this object that he loves from being full of\nfaults and wants. He wants to be great, and he sees himself\nsmall. He wants to be happy, and he sees himself miserable.[Pg 31]He wants to be perfect, and he sees himself full of imperfections.\nHe wants to be the object of love and esteem among men, and\nhe sees that his faults merit only their hatred and contempt.\nThis embarrassment in which he finds himself produces in him\nthe most unrighteous and criminal passion that can be imagined;\nfor he conceives a mortal enmity against that truth which\nreproves him, and which convinces him of his faults. He\nwould annihilate it, but, unable to destroy it in its essence, he\ndestroys it as far as possible in his own knowledge and in that\nof others; that is to say, he devotes all his attention to hiding\nhis faults both from others and from himself, and he cannot\nendure either that others should point them out to him, or that\nthey should see them.Truly it is an evil to be full of faults; but it is a still greater\nevil to be full of them, and to be unwilling to recognise\nthem, since that is to add the further fault of a voluntary\nillusion. We do not like others to deceive us; we do not think\nit fair that they should be held in higher esteem by us than they\ndeserve; it is not then fair that we should deceive them, and\nshould wish them to esteem us more highly than we deserve.Thus, when they discover only the imperfections and vices\nwhich we really have, it is plain they do us no wrong, since it is\nnot they who cause them; they rather do us good, since they\nhelp us to free ourselves from an evil, namely, the ignorance of\nthese imperfections. We ought not to be angry at their knowing\nour faults and despising us; it is but right that they should\nknow us for what we are, and should despise us, if we are\ncontemptible.Such are the feelings that would arise in a heart full of equity\nand justice. What must we say then of our own heart, when\nwe see in it a wholly different disposition? For is it not true\nthat we hate truth and those who tell it us, and that we like\nthem to be deceived in our favour, and prefer to be esteemed by\nthem as being other than what we are in fact? One proof of\nthis makes me shudder. The Catholic religion does not bind\nus to confess our sins indiscriminately to everybody; it allows\nthem to remain hidden from all other men save one, to whom\nshe bids us reveal the innermost recesses of our heart, and show\nourselves as we are. There is only this one man in the world\nwhom she orders us to undeceive, and she binds him to an\ninviolable secrecy, which makes this knowledge to him as if\nit were not. Can we imagine anything more charitable and[Pg 32]pleasant? And yet the corruption of man is such that he finds\neven this law harsh; and it is one of the main reasons which\nhas caused a great part of Europe to rebel against the Church.[61]How unjust and unreasonable is the heart of man, which\nfeels it disagreeable to be obliged to do in regard to one man\nwhat in some measure it were right to do to all men! For is\nit right that we should deceive men?There are different degrees in this aversion to truth; but all\nmay perhaps be said to have it in some degree, because it is\ninseparable from self-love. It is this false delicacy which makes\nthose who are under the necessity of reproving others choose so\nmany windings and middle courses to avoid offence. They\nmust lessen our faults, appear to excuse them, intersperse\npraises and evidence of love and esteem. Despite all this, the\nmedicine does not cease to be bitter to self-love. It takes as\nlittle as it can, always with disgust, and often with a secret\nspite against those who administer it.Hence it happens that if any have some interest in being\nloved by us, they are averse to render us a service which they\nknow to be disagreeable. They treat us as we wish to be treated.\nWe hate the truth, and they hide it from us. We desire flattery,\nand they flatter us. We like to be deceived, and they deceive us.So each degree of good fortune which raises us in the world\nremoves us farther from truth, because we are most afraid of\nwounding those whose affection is most useful and whose dislike\nis most dangerous. A prince may be the byword of all Europe,\nand he alone will know nothing of it. I am not astonished.\nTo tell the truth is useful to those to whom it is spoken, but\ndisadvantageous to those who tell it, because it makes them\ndisliked. Now those who live with princes love their own\ninterests more than that of the prince whom they serve; and so\nthey take care not to confer on him a benefit so as to injure\nthemselves.This evil is no doubt greater and more common among the\nhigher classes; but the lower are not exempt from it, since there\nis always some advantage in making men love us. Human life\nis thus only a perpetual illusion; men deceive and flatter each\nother. No one speaks of us in our presence as he does of us in\nour absence. Human society is founded on mutual deceit;\nfew friendships would endure if each knew what his friend said\nof him in his absence, although he then spoke in sincerity and\nwithout passion.[Pg 33]Man is then only disguise, falsehood, and hypocrisy, both in\nhimself and in regard to others. He does not wish any one to\ntell him the truth; he avoids telling it to others, and all these\ndispositions, so removed from justice and reason, have a natural\nroot in his heart."

A commission in the army would not be bought so\ndearly, but that it is found insufferable not to budge from the\ntown; and men only seek conversation and entering games,\nbecause they cannot remain with pleasure at home.But on further consideration, when, after finding the cause\nof all our ills, I have sought to discover the reason of it, I have\nfound that there is one very real reason, namely, the natural\npoverty of our feeble and mortal condition, so miserable that\nnothing can comfort us when we think of it closely.Whatever condition we picture to ourselves, if we muster all\nthe good things which it is possible to possess, royalty is the\nfinest position in the world. Yet, when we imagine a king\nattended with every pleasure he can feel, if he be without\ndiversion, and be left to consider and reflect on what he is, this\nfeeble happiness will not sustain him; he will necessarily fall\ninto forebodings of dangers, of revolutions which may happen,\nand, finally, of death and inevitable disease; so that if he be\nwithout what is called diversion, he is unhappy, and more\nunhappy than the least of his subjects who plays and diverts\nhimself.Hence it comes that play and the society of women, war, and\nhigh posts, are so sought after. Not that there is in fact any\nhappiness in them, or that men imagine true bliss to consist in\nmoney won at play, or in the hare which they hunt; we would\nnot take these as a gift. We do not seek that easy and peaceful[Pg 40]lot which permits us to think of our unhappy condition, nor\nthe dangers of war, nor the labour of office, but the bustle which\naverts these thoughts of ours, and amuses us.Reasons why we like the chase better than the quarry.Hence it comes that men so much love noise and stir; hence\nit comes that the prison is so horrible a punishment; hence it\ncomes that the pleasure of solitude is a thing incomprehensible.\nAnd it is in fact the greatest source of happiness in the condition\nof kings, that men try incessantly to divert them, and to procure\nfor them all kinds of pleasures.The king is surrounded by persons whose only thought is to\ndivert the king, and to prevent his thinking of self. For he is\nunhappy, king though he be, if he think of himself.This is all that men have been able to discover to make\nthemselves happy. And those who philosophise on the matter,\nand who think men unreasonable for spending a whole day in\nchasing a hare which they would not have bought, scarce know\nour nature. The hare in itself would not screen us from the sight\nof death and calamities; but the chase which turns away our\nattention from these, does screen us.The advice given to Pyrrhus to take the rest which he was\nabout to seek with so much labour, was full of difficulties.[69][To bid a man live quietly is to bid him live happily. It is\nto advise him to be in a state perfectly happy, in which he can\nthink at leisure without finding therein a cause of distress. This\nis to misunderstand nature.As men who naturally understand their own condition avoid\nnothing so much as rest, so there is nothing they leave undone\nin seeking turmoil. Not that they have an instinctive knowledge\nof true happiness ...So we are wrong in blaming them. Their error does not lie\nin seeking excitement, if they seek it only as a diversion; the\nevil is that they seek it as if the possession of the objects of their\nquest would make them really happy. In this respect it is right\nto call their quest a vain one. Hence in all this both the\ncensurers and the censured do not understand man's true nature.]And thus, when we take the exception against them, that\nwhat they seek with such fervour cannot satisfy them, if they\nreplied—as they should do if they considered the matter\nthoroughly—that they sought in it only a violent and impetuous\noccupation which turned their thoughts from self, and that they\ntherefore chose an attractive object to charm and ardently[Pg 41]attract them, they would leave their opponents without a reply.\nBut they do not make this reply, because they do not know\nthemselves.[70]They do not know that it is the chase, and not the\nquarry, which they seek.Dancing: we must consider rightly where to place our feet.—A\ngentleman sincerely believes that hunting is great and royal\nsport; but a beater is not of this opinion.They imagine that if they obtained such a post, they would\nthen rest with pleasure, and are insensible of the insatiable\nnature of their desire. They think they are truly seeking quiet,\nand they are only seeking excitement.They have a secret instinct which impels them to seek amusement\nand occupation abroad, and which arises from the sense of\ntheir constant unhappiness. They have another secret instinct,\na remnant of the greatness of our original nature, which teaches\nthem that happiness in reality consists only in rest, and not in\nstir. And of these two contrary instincts they form within\nthemselves a confused idea, which hides itself from their view\nin the depths of their soul, inciting them to aim at rest through\nexcitement, and always to fancy that the satisfaction which they\nhave not will come to them, if, by surmounting whatever\ndifficulties confront them, they can thereby open the door to rest.Thus passes away all man's life. Men seek rest in a struggle\nagainst difficulties; and when they have conquered these, rest\nbecomes insufferable. For we think either of the misfortunes\nwe have or of those which threaten us. And even if we should\nsee ourselves sufficiently sheltered on all sides, weariness of its\nown accord would not fail to arise from the depths of the heart\nwherein it has its natural roots, and to fill the mind with its\npoison.Thus so wretched is man that he would weary even without\nany cause for weariness from the peculiar state of his disposition;\nand so frivolous is he, that, though full of a thousand reasons for\nweariness, the least thing, such as playing billiards or hitting a\nball, is sufficient to amuse him.But will you say what object has he in all this? The pleasure\nof bragging to-morrow among his friends that he has played\nbetter than another. So others sweat in their own rooms to\nshow to the learned that they have solved a problem in algebra,\nwhich no one had hitherto been able to solve. Many more\nexpose themselves to extreme perils, in my opinion as foolishly,\nin order to boast afterwards that they have captured a town.[Pg 42]Lastly, others wear themselves out in studying all these things,\nnot in order to become wiser, but only in order to prove that\nthey know them; and these are the most senseless of the band,\nsince they are so knowingly, whereas one may suppose of the\nothers, that if they knew it, they would no longer be foolish.This man spends his life without weariness in playing every\nday for a small stake. Give him each morning the money he\ncan win each day, on condition he does not play; you make him\nmiserable. It will perhaps be said that he seeks the amusement\nof play and not the winnings. Make him then play for\nnothing; he will not become excited over it, and will feel bored.\nIt is then not the amusement alone that he seeks; a languid and\npassionless amusement will weary him. He must get excited\nover it, and deceive himself by the fancy that he will be happy to\nwin what he would not have as a gift on condition of not playing;\nand he must make for himself an object of passion, and excite\nover it his desire, his anger, his fear, to obtain his imagined end,\nas children are frightened at the face they have blackened.Whence comes it that this man, who lost his only son a few\nmonths ago, or who this morning was in such trouble through\nbeing distressed by lawsuits and quarrels, now no longer thinks\nof them? Do not wonder; he is quite taken up in looking out\nfor the boar which his dogs have been hunting so hotly for the\nlast six hours. He requires nothing more. However full of\nsadness a man may be, he is happy for the time, if you can\nprevail upon him to enter into some amusement; and however\nhappy a man may be, he will soon be discontented and wretched,\nif he be not diverted and occupied by some passion or pursuit\nwhich prevents weariness from overcoming him. Without\namusement there is no joy; with amusement there is no sadness.\nAnd this also constitutes the happiness of persons in high\nposition, that they have a number of people to amuse them, and\nhave the power to keep themselves in this state.Consider this. What is it to be superintendent, chancellor,\nfirst president, but to be in a condition wherein from early\nmorning a large number of people come from all quarters to see\nthem, so as not to leave them an hour in the day in which they\ncan think of themselves? And when they are in disgrace and\nsent back to their country houses, where they lack neither\nwealth nor servants to help them on occasion, they do not fail\nto be wretched and desolate, because no one prevents them from\nthinking of themselves.[Pg 43]"

If this religion boasted of having a clear\nview of God, and of possessing it open and unveiled, it would be\nattacking it to say that we see nothing in the world which shows\nit with this clearness. But since, on the contrary, it says that\nmen are in darkness and estranged from God, that He has\nhidden Himself from their knowledge, that this is in fact the\nname which He gives Himself in the Scriptures,Deus absconditus;[86]and finally, if it endeavours equally to establish these two\nthings: that God has set up in the Church visible signs to make\nHimself known to those who should seek Him sincerely, and\nthat He has nevertheless so disguised them that He will only be\nperceived by those who seek Him with all their heart; what\nadvantage can they obtain, when, in the negligence with which\nthey make profession of being in search of the truth, they cry\nout that nothing reveals it to them; and since that darkness in\nwhich they are, and with which they upbraid the Church,\nestablishes only one of the things which she affirms, without\ntouching the other, and, very far from destroying, proves her\ndoctrine?In order to attack it, they should have protested that they had\nmade every effort to seek Him everywhere, and even in that\nwhich the Church proposes for their instruction, but without\nsatisfaction. If they talked in this manner, they would in\ntruth be attacking one of her pretensions. But I hope here to\nshow that no reasonable person can speak thus, and I venture[Pg 54]even to say that no one has ever done so. We know well\nenough how those who are of this mind behave. They believe\nthey have made great efforts for their instruction, when they\nhave spent a few hours in reading some book of Scripture, and\nhave questioned some priest on the truths of the faith. After\nthat, they boast of having made vain search in books and among\nmen. But, verily, I will tell them what I have often said, that\nthis negligence is insufferable. We are not here concerned\nwith the trifling interests of some stranger, that we should treat\nit in this fashion; the matter concerns ourselves and our all.The immortality of the soul is a matter which is of so great\nconsequence to us, and which touches us so profoundly, that we\nmust have lost all feeling to be indifferent as to knowing what\nit is. All our actions and thoughts must take such different\ncourses, according as there are or are not eternal joys to hope\nfor, that it is impossible to take one step with sense and judgment,\nunless we regulate our course by our view of this point\nwhich ought to be our ultimate end.Thus our first interest and our first duty is to enlighten ourselves\non this subject, whereon depends all our conduct. Therefore\namong those who do not believe, I make a vast difference\nbetween those who strive with all their power to inform themselves,\nand those who live without troubling or thinking about it.I can have only compassion for those who sincerely bewail\ntheir doubt, who regard it as the greatest of misfortunes, and\nwho, sparing no effort to escape it, make of this inquiry their\nprincipal and most serious occupations.But as for those who pass their life without thinking of this\nultimate end of life, and who, for this sole reason that they do\nnot find within themselves the lights which convince them of it,\nneglect to seek them elsewhere, and to examine thoroughly\nwhether this opinion is one of those which people receive with\ncredulous simplicity, or one of those which, although obscure in\nthemselves, have nevertheless a solid and immovable foundation,\nI look upon them in a manner quite different.This carelessness in a matter which concerns themselves,\ntheir eternity, their all, moves me more to anger than pity; it\nastonishes and shocks me; it is to me monstrous. I do not say\nthis out of the pious zeal of a spiritual devotion. I expect, on\nthe contrary, that we ought to have this feeling from principles\nof human interest and self-love; for this we need only see what\nthe least enlightened persons see.[Pg 55]We do not require great education of the mind to understand\nthat here is no real and lasting satisfaction; that our pleasures\nare only vanity; that our evils are infinite; and, lastly, that\ndeath, which threatens us every moment, must infallibly place\nus within a few years under the dreadful necessity of being for\never either annihilated or unhappy.There is nothing more real than this, nothing more terrible.\nBe we as heroic as we like, that is the end which awaits the noblest\nlife in the world. Let us reflect on this, and then say whether\nit is not beyond doubt that there is no good in this life but in the\nhope of another; that we are happy only in proportion as we\ndraw near it; and that, as there are no more woes for those who\nhave complete assurance of eternity, so there is no more happiness\nfor those who have no insight into it.Surely then it is a great evil thus to be in doubt, but it is at\nleast an indispensable duty to seek when we are in such doubt;\nand thus the doubter who does not seek is altogether completely\nunhappy and completely wrong. And if besides this he is easy\nand content, professes to be so, and indeed boasts of it; if it is this\nstate itself which is the subject of his joy and vanity, I have no\nwords to describe so silly a creature.How can people hold these opinions? What joy can we find\nin the expectation of nothing but hopeless misery? What\nreason for boasting that we are in impenetrable darkness?\nAnd how can it happen that the following argument occurs to\na reasonable man?\"I know not who put me into the world, nor what the world\nis, nor what I myself am. I am in terrible ignorance of everything.\nI know not what my body is, nor my senses, nor my\nsoul, not even that part of me which thinks what I say, which\nreflects on all and on itself, and knows itself no more than the\nrest. I see those frightful spaces of the universe which surround\nme, and I find myself tied to one corner of this vast expanse,\nwithout knowing why I am put in this place rather than in\nanother, nor why the short time which is given me to live is\nassigned to me at this point rather than at another of the whole\neternity which was before me or which shall come after me. I\nsee nothing but infinites on all sides, which surround me as an\natom, and as a shadow which endures only for an instant and\nreturns no more. All I know is that I must soon die, but what\nI know least is this very death which I cannot escape.\"As I know not whence I come, so I know not whither I go.[Pg 56]I know only that, in leaving this world, I fall for ever either\ninto annihilation or into the hands of an angry God, without\nknowing to which of these two states I shall be for ever assigned.\nSuch is my state, full of weakness and uncertainty. And from\nall this I conclude that I ought to spend all the days of my life\nwithout caring to inquire into what must happen to me. Perhaps\nI might find some solution to my doubts, but I will not\ntake the trouble, nor take a step to seek it; and after treating\nwith scorn those who are concerned with this care, I will go\nwithout foresight and without fear to try the great event, and\nlet myself be led carelessly to death, uncertain of the eternity\nof my future state.\"Who would desire to have for a friend a man who talks in this\nfashion? Who would choose him out from others to tell him\nof his affairs? Who would have recourse to him in affliction?\nAnd indeed to what use in life could one put him?In truth, it is the glory of religion to have for enemies men so\nunreasonable: and their opposition to it is so little dangerous\nthat it serves on the contrary to establish its truths. For the\nChristian faith goes mainly to establish these two facts, the\ncorruption of nature, and redemption by Jesus Christ. Now I\ncontend that if these men do not serve to prove the truth of the\nredemption by the holiness of their behaviour, they at least\nserve admirably to show the corruption of nature by sentiments\nso unnatural.Nothing is so important to man as his own state, nothing is\nso formidable to him as eternity; and thus it is not natural that\nthere should be men indifferent to the loss of their existence, and\nto the perils of everlasting suffering. They are quite different\nwith regard to all other things. They are afraid of mere trifles;\nthey foresee them; they feel them. And this same man who\nspends so many days and nights in rage and despair for the loss\nof office, or for some imaginary insult to his honour, is the very\none who knows without anxiety and without emotion that he\nwill lose all by death. It is a monstrous thing to see in the\nsame heart and at the same time this sensibility to trifles and\nthis strange insensibility to the greatest objects. It is an\nincomprehensible enchantment, and a supernatural slumber,\nwhich indicates as its cause an all-powerful force.There must be a strange confusion in the nature of man, that\nhe should boast of being in that state in which it seems incredible\nthat a single individual should be. However, experience has[Pg 57]shown me so great a number of such persons that the fact would\nbe surprising, if we did not know that the greater part of those\nwho trouble themselves about the matter are disingenuous, and\nnot in fact what they say. They are people who have heard it\nsaid that it is the fashion to be thus daring. It is what they\ncall shaking off the yoke, and they try to imitate this. But it\nwould not be difficult to make them understand how greatly\nthey deceive themselves in thus seeking esteem. This is not\nthe way to gain it, even I say among those men of the world\nwho take a healthy view of things, and who know that the only\nway to succeed in this life is to make ourselves appear honourable,\nfaithful, judicious, and capable of useful service to a friend;\nbecause naturally men love only what may be useful to them.\nNow, what do we gain by hearing it said of a man that he has\nnow thrown off the yoke, that he does not believe there is a God\nwho watches our actions, that he considers himself the sole\nmaster of his conduct, and that he thinks he is accountable for\nit only to himself? Does he think that he has thus brought us\nto have henceforth complete confidence in him, and to look to\nhim for consolation, advice, and help in every need of life? Do\nthey profess to have delighted us by telling us that they hold\nour soul to be only a little wind and smoke, especially by telling\nus this in a haughty and self-satisfied tone of voice? Is this a\nthing to say gaily? Is it not, on the contrary, a thing to say\nsadly, as the saddest thing in the world?If they thought of it seriously, they would see that this is so\nbad a mistake, so contrary to good sense, so opposed to decency\nand so removed in every respect from that good breeding which\nthey seek, that they would be more likely to correct than to\npervert those who had an inclination to follow them. And\nindeed, make them give an account of their opinions, and of the\nreasons which they have for doubting religion, and they will\nsay to you things so feeble and so petty, that they will persuade\nyou of the contrary. The following is what a person one day\nsaid to such a one very appositely: \"If you continue to talk\nin this manner, you will really make me religious.\" And he\nwas right, for who would not have a horror of holding opinions in\nwhich he would have such contemptible persons as companions!Thus those who only feign these opinions would be very\nunhappy, if they restrained their natural feelings in order to\nmake themselves the most conceited of men. If, at the bottom\nof their heart, they are troubled at not having more light, let[Pg 58]them not disguise the fact; this avowal will not be shameful.\nThe only shame is to have none. Nothing reveals more an\nextreme weakness of mind than not to know the misery of a\ngodless man. Nothing is more indicative of a bad disposition of\nheart than not to desire the truth of eternal promises. Nothing\nis more dastardly than to act with bravado before God. Let\nthem then leave these impieties to those who are sufficiently ill-bred\nto be really capable of them. Let them at least be honest\nmen, if they cannot be Christians. Finally, let them recognise\nthat there are two kinds of people one can call reasonable; those\nwho serve God with all their heart because they know Him, and\nthose who seek Him with all their heart because they do not\nknow Him.But as for those who live without knowing Him and without\nseeking Him, they judge themselves so little worthy of their own\ncare, that they are not worthy of the care of others; and it needs\nall the charity of the religion which they despise, not to despise\nthem even to the point of leaving them to their folly. But because\nthis religion obliges us always to regard them, so long as\nthey are in this life, as capable of the grace which can enlighten\nthem, and to believe that they may, in a little time, be more\nreplenished with faith than we are, and that, on the other hand,\nwe may fall into the blindness wherein they are, we must do\nfor them what we would they should do for us if we were in\ntheir place, and call upon them to have pity upon themselves,\nand to take at least some steps in the endeavour to find light.\nLet them give to reading this some of the hours which they\notherwise employ so uselessly; whatever aversion they may\nbring to the task, they will perhaps gain something, and at\nleast will not lose much. But as for those who bring to the task\nperfect sincerity and a real desire to meet with truth, those I\nhope will be satisfied and convinced of the proofs of a religion\nso divine, which I have here collected, and in which I have\nfollowed somewhat after this order ..."

They are in peril of\neternal woe; and thereupon, as if the matter were not worth\nthe trouble, they neglect to inquire whether this is one of those\nopinions which people receive with too credulous a facility, or\none of those which, obscure in themselves, have a very firm,\nthough hidden, foundation. Thus they know not whether\nthere be truth or falsity in the matter, nor whether there be\nstrength or weakness in the proofs. They have them before\ntheir eyes; they refuse to look at them; and in that ignorance\nthey choose all that is necessary to fall into this misfortune if\nit exists, to await death to make trial of it, yet to be very\ncontent in this state, to make profession of it, and indeed to\nboast of it. Can we think seriously on the importance of this\nsubject without being horrified at conduct so extravagant?This resting in ignorance is a monstrous thing, and they who\npass their life in it must be made to feel its extravagance and\nstupidity, by having it shown to them, so that they may be\nconfounded by the sight of their folly. For this is how men\nreason, when they choose to live in such ignorance of what they[Pg 60]are, and without seeking enlightenment. \"I know not,\" they\nsay ..."

The finite is annihilated in the\npresence of the infinite, and becomes a pure nothing. So our\nspirit before God, so our justice before divine justice. There is\nnot so great a disproportion between our justice and that of\nGod, as between unity and infinity.The justice of God must be vast like His compassion. Now\njustice to the outcast is less vast, and ought less to offend our\nfeelings than mercy towards the elect.We know that there is an infinite, and are ignorant of its\nnature. As we know it to be false that numbers are finite, it\nis therefore true that there is an infinity in number. But we do\nnot know what it is. It is false that it is even, it is false that it\nis odd; for the addition of a unit can make no change in its nature.\nYet it is a number, and every number is odd or even (this is\ncertainly true of every finite number). So we may well know\nthat there is a God without knowing what He is. Is there not\none substantial truth, seeing there are so many things which are\nnot the truth itself?[Pg 66]We know then the existence and nature of the finite, because\nwe also are finite and have extension.

Now, I have already shown that we may well\nknow the existence of a thing, without knowing its nature.Let us now speak according to natural lights.If there is a God, He is infinitely incomprehensible, since,\nhaving neither parts nor limits, He has no affinity to us. We\nare then incapable of knowing either what He is or if He is.\nThis being so, who will dare to undertake the decision of the\nquestion? Not we, who have no affinity to Him.Who then will blame Christians for not being able to give a\nreason for their belief, since they profess a religion for which\nthey cannot give a reason? They declare, in expounding it to\nthe world, that it is a foolishness,stultitiam;[90]and then you\ncomplain that they do not prove it! If they proved it, they\nwould not keep their word; it is in lacking proofs, that they are\nnot lacking in sense. \"Yes, but although this excuses those who\noffer it as such, and takes away from them the blame of putting\nit forward without reason, it does not excuse those who receive\nit.\" Let us then examine this point, and say, \"God is, or He\nis not.\" But to which side shall we incline? Reason can decide\nnothing here. There is an infinite chaos which separated us.\nA game is being played at the extremity of this infinite distance\nwhere heads or tails will turn up. What will you wager?\nAccording to reason, you can do neither the one thing nor the\nother; according to reason, you can defend neither of the\npropositions.Do not then reprove for error those who have made a choice;\nfor you know nothing about it. \"No, but I blame them for\nhaving made, not this choice, but a choice; for again both he\nwho chooses heads and he who chooses tails are equally at fault,\nthey are both in the wrong. The true course is not to wager\nat all.\"Yes; but you must wager. It is not optional. You are\nembarked. Which will you choose then? Let us see. Since\nyou must choose, let us see which interests you least. You have\ntwo things to lose, the true and the good; and two things to stake,[Pg 67]your reason and your will, your knowledge and your happiness;\nand your nature has two things to shun, error and misery.\nYour reason is no more shocked in choosing one rather than the\nother, since you must of necessity choose. This is one point\nsettled. But your happiness? Let us weigh the gain and the\nloss in wagering that God is. Let us estimate these two chances.\nIf you gain, you gain all; if you lose, you lose nothing. Wager,\nthen, without hesitation that He is.—\"That is very fine. Yes,\nI must wager; but I may perhaps wager too much.\"—Let us\nsee. Since there is an equal risk of gain and of loss, if you had\nonly to gain two lives, instead of one, you might still wager.\nBut if there were three lives to gain, you would have to play\n(since you are under the necessity of playing), and you would\nbe imprudent, when you are forced to play, not to chance your\nlife to gain three at a game where there is an equal risk of loss\nand gain. But there is an eternity of life and happiness. And\nthis being so, if there were an infinity of chances, of which one\nonly would be for you, you would still be right in wagering one\nto win two, and you would act stupidly, being obliged to play,\nby refusing to stake one life against three at a game in which out\nof an infinity of chances there is one for you, if there were an\ninfinity of an infinitely happy life to gain. But there is here an\ninfinity of an infinitely happy life to gain, a chance of gain\nagainst a finite number of chances of loss, and what you stake is\nfinite. It is all divided; wherever the infinite is and there is not\nan infinity of chances of loss against that of gain, there is no\ntime to hesitate, you must give all. And thus, when one is\nforced to play, he must renounce reason to preserve his life,\nrather than risk it for infinite gain, as likely to happen as the\nloss of nothingness.For it is no use to say it is uncertain if we will gain, and it is\ncertain that we risk, and that the infinite distance between thecertaintyof what is staked and theuncertaintyof what will be\ngained, equals the finite good which is certainly staked against\nthe uncertain infinite. It is not so, as every player stakes a\ncertainty to gain an uncertainty, and yet he stakes a finite\ncertainty to gain a finite uncertainty, without transgressing\nagainst reason. There is not an infinite distance between the\ncertainty staked and the uncertainty of the gain; that is untrue.\nIn truth, there is an infinity between the certainty of gain\nand the certainty of loss. But the uncertainty of the gain is\nproportioned to the certainty of the stake according to the[Pg 68]proportion of the chances of gain and loss. Hence it comes that,\nif there are as many risks on one side as on the other, the course\nis to play even; and then the certainty of the stake is equal to\nthe uncertainty of the gain, so far is it from fact that there is an\ninfinite distance between them. And so our proposition is of\ninfinite force, when there is the finite to stake in a game where\nthere are equal risks of gain and of loss, and the infinite to gain.\nThis is demonstrable; and if men are capable of any truths, this\nis one.\"I confess it, I admit it.

But at least learn your inability to believe, since\nreason brings you to this, and yet you cannot believe. Endeavour\nthen to convince yourself, not by increase of proofs of\nGod, but by the abatement of your passions. You would like\nto attain faith, and do not know the way; you would like to\ncure yourself of unbelief, and ask the remedy for it. Learn\nof those who have been bound like you, and who now stake all\ntheir possessions. These are people who know the way which\nyou would follow, and who are cured of an ill of which you would\nbe cured. Follow the way by which they began; by acting as if\nthey believed, taking the holy water, having masses said, etc.\nEven this will naturally make you believe, and deaden your\nacuteness.—\"But this is what I am afraid of.\"—And why?\nWhat have you to lose?But to show you that this leads you there, it is this which will\nlessen the passions, which are your stumbling-blocks.The end of this discourse.—Now, what harm will befall you in\ntaking this side? You will be faithful, honest, humble, grateful,\ngenerous, a sincere friend, truthful. Certainly you will not\nhave those poisonous pleasures, glory and luxury; but will you\nnot have others? I will tell you that you will thereby gain in\nthis life, and that, at each step you take on this road, you will\nsee so great certainty of gain, so much nothingness in what you\nrisk, that you will at last recognise that you have wagered for\nsomething certain and infinite, for which you have given nothing.\"Ah! This discourse transports me, charms me,\" etc.If this discourse pleases you and seems impressive, know[Pg 69]that it is made by a man who has knelt, both before and after\nit, in prayer to that Being, infinite and without parts, before\nwhom he lays all he has, for you also to lay before Him all you\nhave for your own good and for His glory, that so strength may\nbe given to lowliness."

In addressing their argument to infidels, their\nfirst chapter is to prove Divinity from the works of nature.[91]I\nshould not be astonished at their enterprise, if they were\naddressing their argument to the faithful; for it is certain that\nthose who have the living faith in their heart see at once that\nall existence is none other than the work of the God whom they\nadore. But for those in whom this light is extinguished, and in\nwhom we purpose to rekindle it, persons destitute of faith and\ngrace, who, seeking with all their light whatever they see in\nnature that can bring them to this knowledge, find only obscurity\nand darkness; to tell them that they have only to look at the\nsmallest things which surround them, and they will see God\nopenly, to give them, as a complete proof of this great and\nimportant matter, the course of the moon and planets, and to\nclaim to have concluded the proof with such an argument, is to\ngive them ground for believing that the proofs of our religion\nare very weak. And I see by reason and experience that nothing\nis more calculated to arouse their contempt.It is not after this manner that Scripture speaks, which has\na better knowledge of the things that are of God. It says, on\nthe contrary, that God is a hidden God, and that, since the\ncorruption of nature, He has left men in a darkness from which\nthey can escape only through Jesus Christ, without whom all\ncommunion with God is cut off.Nemo novit Patrem, nisi\nFilius, et cui voluerit Filius revelare.[92]This is what Scripture points out to us, when it says in so\nmany places that those who seek God find Him.[93]It is not of\nthat light, \"like the noonday sun,\" that this is said. We do[Pg 72]not say that those who seek the noonday sun, or water in the\nsea, shall find them; and hence the evidence of God must not\nbe of this nature.

Man is ignorant of it.Certainly had he known it, he would not have established this\nmaxim, the most general of all that obtain among men, that\neach should follow the custom of his own country. The glory\nof true equity would have brought all nations under subjection,\nand legislators would not have taken as their model the fancies\nand caprice of Persians and Germans instead of this unchanging\njustice. We should have seen it set up in all the States on earth\nand in all times; whereas we see neither justice nor injustice\nwhich does not change its nature with change in climate. Three\ndegrees of latitude reverse all jurisprudence; a meridian decides\nthe truth. Fundamental laws change after a few years of\npossession; right has its epochs; the entry of Saturn into the Lion[Pg 84]marks to us the origin of such and such a crime. A strange\njustice that is bounded by a river! Truth on this side of the\nPyrenees, error on the other side.Men admit that justice does not consist in these customs, but\nthat it resides in natural laws, common to every country. They\nwould certainly maintain it obstinately, if reckless chance which\nhas distributed human laws had encountered even one which\nwas universal; but the farce is that the caprice of men has so\nmany vagaries that there is no such law.Theft, incest, infanticide, parricide, have all had a place among\nvirtuous actions. Can anything be more ridiculous than that\na man should have the right to kill me because he lives on the\nother side of the water, and because his ruler has a quarrel with\nmine, though I have none with him?Doubtless there are natural laws; but good reason once\ncorrupted has corrupted all.Nihil amplius nostrum est;[110]quod\nnostrum dicimus, artis est. Ex senatus—consultis et plebiscitis\ncrimina exercentur.[111]Ut olim vitiis, sic nunc legibus laboramus.[112]The result of this confusion is that one affirms the essence of\njustice to be the authority of the legislator; another, the interest\nof the sovereign;[113]another, present custom,[114]and this is the most\nsure. Nothing, according to reason alone, is just in itself; all\nchanges with time. Custom creates the whole of equity, for\nthe simple reason that it is accepted. It is the mystical foundation\nof its authority;[115]whoever carries it back to first principles\ndestroys it. Nothing is so faulty as those laws which correct\nfaults. He who obeys them because they are just, obeys a\njustice which is imaginary, and not the essence of law; it is quite\nself-contained, it is law and nothing more. He who will examine\nits motive will find it so feeble and so trifling that if he be not\naccustomed to contemplate the wonders of human imagination,\nhe will marvel that one century has gained for it so much pomp\nand reverence. The art of opposition and of revolution is to\nunsettle established customs, sounding them even to their\nsource, to point out their want of authority and justice. We\nmust, it is said, get back to the natural and fundamental laws of\nthe State, which an unjust custom has abolished. It is a game\ncertain to result in the loss of all; nothing will be just on the\nbalance. Yet people readily lend their ear to such arguments.\nThey shake off the yoke as soon as they recognise it; and the\ngreat profit by their ruin, and by that of these curious investigators\nof accepted customs. But from a contrary mistake[Pg 85]men sometimes think they can justly do everything which is\nnot without an example. That is why the wisest of legislators[116]said that it was necessary to deceive men for their own good;\nand another, a good politician,Cum veritatem qua liberetur\nignoret, expedit quod fallatur.[117]We must not see the fact of\nusurpation; law was once introduced without reason, and has\nbecome reasonable. We must make it regarded as authoritative,\neternal, and conceal its origin, if we do not wish that it should\nsoon come to an end."

Whatever\ndifferent means they employ, they all tend to this end.[159]The cause of some going to war, and of others avoiding it, is the\nsame desire in both, attended with different views. The will\nnever takes the least step but to this object. This is the motive\nof every action of every man, even of those who hang themselves.And yet after such a great number of years, no one without\nfaith has reached the point to which all continually look. All\ncomplain, princes and subjects, noblemen and commoners, old\nand young, strong and weak, learned and ignorant, healthy and\nsick, of all countries, all times, all ages, and all conditions.A trial so long, so continuous, and so uniform, should certainly\nconvince us of our inability to reach the good by our own efforts.\nBut example teaches us little. No resemblance is ever so perfect\nthat there is not some slight difference; and hence we expect\nthat our hope will not be deceived on this occasion as before.\nAnd thus, while the present never satisfies us, experience dupes\nus, and from misfortune to misfortune leads us to death, their\neternal crown.What is it then that this desire and this inability proclaim to\nus, but that there was once in man a true happiness of which\nthere now remain to him only the mark and empty trace, which\nhe in vain tries to fill from all his surroundings, seeking from\nthings absent the help he does not obtain in things present?\nBut these are all inadequate, because the infinite abyss can\nonly be filled by an infinite and immutable object, that is to say,\nonly by God Himself.He only is our true good, and since we have forsaken Him, it[Pg 114]is a strange thing that there is nothing in nature which has not\nbeen serviceable in taking His place; the stars, the heavens,\nearth, the elements, plants, cabbages, leeks, animals, insects,\ncalves, serpents, fever, pestilence, war, famine, vices, adultery,\nincest. And since man has lost the true good, everything can\nappear equally good to him, even his own destruction, though so\nopposed to God, to reason, and to the whole course of nature.Some seek good in authority, others in scientific research,\nothers in pleasure. Others, who are in fact nearer the truth,\nhave considered it necessary that the universal good, which all\nmen desire, should not consist in any of the particular things\nwhich can only be possessed by one man, and which, when\nshared, afflict their possessor more by the want of the part he has\nnot, than they please him by the possession of what he has.\nThey have learned that the true good should be such as all can\npossess at once, without diminution and without envy, and\nwhich no one can lose against his will.

The beginning, after having explained the\nincomprehensibility.—The greatness and the wretchedness of[Pg 115]man are so evident that the true religion must necessarily teach\nus both that there is in man some great source of greatness, and\na great source of wretchedness. It must then give us a reason\nfor these astonishing contradictions.In order to make man happy, it must prove to him that there\nis a God; that we ought to love Him; that our true happiness is\nto be in Him, and our sole evil to be separated from Him; it\nmust recognise that we are full of darkness which hinders us\nfrom knowing and loving Him; and that thus, as our duties\ncompel us to love God, and our lusts turn us away from Him,\nwe are full of unrighteousness. It must give us an explanation\nof our opposition to God and to our own good. It must teach\nus the remedies for these infirmities, and the means of obtaining\nthese remedies. Let us therefore examine all the religions of\nthe world, and see if there be any other than the Christian which\nis sufficient for this purpose.Shall it be that of the philosophers, who put forward as the\nchief good, the good which is in ourselves? Is this the true good?\nHave they found the remedy for our ills? Is man's pride cured\nby placing him on an equality with God? Have those who have\nmade us equal to the brutes, or the Mahommedans who have\noffered us earthly pleasures as the chief good even in eternity,\nproduced the remedy for our lusts? What religion, then, will\nteach us to cure pride and lust? What religion will in fact teach\nus our good, our duties, the weakness which turns us from them,\nthe cause of this weakness, the remedies which can cure it, and\nthe means of obtaining these remedies?All other religions have not been able to do so. Let us see\nwhat the wisdom of God will do.\"Expect neither truth,\" she says, \"nor consolation from men.\nI am she who formed you, and who alone can teach you what\nyou are. But you are now no longer in the state in which I\nformed you. I created man holy, innocent, perfect. I filled\nhim with light and intelligence. I communicated to him my\nglory and my wonders. The eye of man saw then the majesty\nof God. He was not then in the darkness which blinds him, nor\nsubject to mortality and the woes which afflict him. But he\nhas not been able to sustain so great glory without falling into\npride. He wanted to make himself his own centre, and independent\nof my help. He withdrew himself from my rule; and,\non his making himself equal to me by the desire of finding his\nhappiness in himself, I abandoned him to himself. And setting[Pg 116]in revolt the creatures that were subject to him, I made them\nhis enemies; so that man is now become like the brutes, and so\nestranged from me that there scarce remains to him a dim vision\nof his Author. So far has all his knowledge been extinguished\nor disturbed! The senses, independent of reason, and often the\nmasters of reason, have led him into pursuit of pleasure. All\ncreatures either torment or tempt him, and domineer over him,\neither subduing him by their strength, or fascinating him by\ntheir charms, a tyranny more awful and more imperious.\"Such is the state in which men now are. There remains to\nthem some feeble instinct of the happiness of their former state;\nand they are plunged in the evils of their blindness and their\nlust, which have become their second nature.\"From this principle which I disclose to you, you can recognise\nthe cause of those contradictions which have astonished all men,\nand have divided them into parties holding so different views.\nObserve, now, all the feelings of greatness and glory which the\nexperience of so many woes cannot stifle, and see if the cause of\nthem must not be in another nature.\"For Port-Royal to-morrow (Prosopopœa).—\"It is in vain, O\nmen, that you seek within yourselves the remedy for your ills.\nAll your light can only reach the knowledge that not in yourselves\nwill you find truth or good. The philosophers have\npromised you that, and have been unable to do it. They\nneither know what is your true good, nor what is your true\nstate. How could they have given remedies for your ills, when\nthey did not even know them? Your chief maladies are pride,\nwhich takes you away from God, and lust, which binds you to\nearth; and they have done nothing else but cherish one or other\nof these diseases. If they gave you God as an end, it was only\nto administer to your pride; they made you think that you are\nby nature like Him, and conformed to Him. And those who\nsaw the absurdity of this claim put you on another precipice, by\nmaking you understand that your nature was like that of the\nbrutes, and led you to seek your good in the lusts which are\nshared by the animals. This is not the way to cure you of your\nunrighteousness, which these wise men never knew. I alone\ncan make you understand who you are....\"Adam, Jesus Christ.If you are united to God, it is by grace, not by nature. If you\nare humbled, it is by penitence, not by nature.Thus this double capacity ...[Pg 117]You are not in the state of your creation.As these two states are open, it is impossible for you not to\nrecognise them. Follow your own feelings, observe yourselves,\nand see if you do not find the lively characteristics of these two\nnatures. Could so many contradictions be found in a simple\nsubject?—Incomprehensible.—Not all that is incomprehensible ceases\nto exist. Infinite number. An infinite space equal to a finite.—Incredible that God should unite Himself to us.—This\nconsideration is drawn only from the sight of our vileness. But\nif you are quite sincere over it, follow it as far as I have done,\nand recognise that we are indeed so vile that we are incapable in\nourselves of knowing if His mercy cannot make us capable of\nHim. For I would know how this animal, who knows himself\nto be so weak, has the right to measure the mercy of God, and\nset limits to it, suggested by his own fancy. He has so little\nknowledge of what God is, that he does not know what he himself\nis, and, completely disturbed at the sight of his own state,\ndares to say that God cannot make him capable of communion\nwith Him.But I would ask him if God demands anything else from him\nthan the knowledge and love of Him, and why, since his nature\nis capable of love and knowledge, he believes that God cannot\nmake Himself known and loved by him. Doubtless he knows\nat least that he exists, and that he loves something. Therefore,\nif he sees anything in the darkness wherein he is, and if he finds\nsome object of his love among the things on earth, why, if God\nimpart to him some ray of His essence, will he not be capable of\nknowing and of loving Him in the manner in which it shall please\nHim to communicate Himself to us? There must then be\ncertainly an intolerable presumption in arguments of this sort,\nalthough they seem founded on an apparent humility, which is\nneither sincere nor reasonable, if it does not make us admit that,\nnot knowing of ourselves what we are, we can only learn it\nfrom God.\"I do not mean that you should submit your belief to me\nwithout reason, and I do not aspire to overcome you by tyranny.\nIn fact, I do not claim to give you a reason for everything. And\nto reconcile these contradictions, I intend to make you see\nclearly, by convincing proofs, those divine signs in me, which\nmay convince you of what I am, and may gain authority for me\nby wonders and proofs which you cannot reject; so that you may[Pg 118]then believe without ... the things which I teach you, since you\nwill find no other ground for rejecting them, except that you\ncannot know of yourselves if they are true or not.\"God has willed to redeem men, and to open salvation to\nthose who seek it. But men render themselves so unworthy of\nit, that it is right that God should refuse to some, because of their\nobduracy, what He grants to others from a compassion which is\nnot due to them. If He had willed to overcome the obstinacy\nof the most hardened, He could have done so by revealing Himself\nso manifestly to them that they could not have doubted of\nthe truth of His essence; as it will appear at the last day, with\nsuch thunders and such a convulsion of nature, that the dead\nwill rise again, and the blindest will see Him.\"It is not in this manner that He has willed to appear in His\nadvent of mercy, because, as so many make themselves unworthy\nof His mercy, He has willed to leave them in the loss of\nthe good which they do not want. It was not then right that He\nshould appear in a manner manifestly divine, and completely\ncapable of convincing all men; but it was also not right that He\nshould come in so hidden a manner that He could not be known\nby those who should sincerely seek Him. He has willed to make\nHimself quite recognisable by those; and thus, willing to appear\nopenly to those who seek Him with all their heart, and to be\nhidden from those who flee from Him with all their heart, He\nso regulates the knowledge of Himself that He has given signs of\nHimself, visible to those who seek Him, and not to those who\nseek Him not. There is enough light for those who only desire\nto see, and enough obscurity for those who have a contrary\ndisposition.\""

Now this natural\nintuition is not a convincing proof of their truth; since, having\nno certainty, apart from faith, whether man was created by a\ngood God, or by a wicked demon,[161]or by chance, it is doubtful\nwhether these principles given to us are true, or false, or uncertain,\naccording to our origin. Again, no person is certain, apart from\nfaith, whether he is awake or sleeps, seeing that during sleep we\nbelieve that we are awake as firmly as we do when weareawake;\nwe believe that we see space, figure, and motion; we are aware\nof the passage of time, we measure it; and in fact we act as if\nwe were awake. So that half of our life being passed in sleep, we\nhave on our own admission no idea of truth, whatever we may\nimagine. As all our intuitions are then illusions, who knows[Pg 120]whether the other half of our life, in which we think we are awake,\nis not another sleep a little different from the former, from which\nwe awake when we suppose ourselves asleep?[And who doubts that, if we dreamt in company, and the\ndreams chanced to agree, which is common enough, and if we\nwere always alone when awake, we should believe that matters\nwere reversed? In short, as we often dream that we dream,\nheaping dream upon dream, may it not be that this half of our\nlife, wherein we think ourselves awake, is itself only a dream on\nwhich the others are grafted, from which we wake at death,\nduring which we have as few principles of truth and good as\nduring natural sleep, these different thoughts which disturb us\nbeing perhaps only illusions like the flight of time and the vain\nfancies of our dreams?]These are the chief arguments on one side and the other.I omit minor ones, such as the sceptical talk against the\nimpressions of custom, education, manners, country, and the\nlike. Though these influence the majority of common folk,\nwho dogmatise only on shallow foundations, they are upset by\nthe least breath of the sceptics. We have only to see their\nbooks if we are not sufficiently convinced of this, and we shall\nvery quickly become so, perhaps too much.I notice the only strong point of the dogmatists, namely, that,\nspeaking in good faith and sincerely, we cannot doubt natural\nprinciples. Against this the sceptics set up in one word the\nuncertainty of our origin, which includes that of our nature.\nThe dogmatists have been trying to answer this objection ever\nsince the world began.So there is open war among men, in which each must take a\npart, and side either with dogmatism or scepticism. For he\nwho thinks to remain neutral is above all a sceptic. This\nneutrality is the essence of the sect; he who is not against them\nis essentially for them. [In this appears their advantage.]\nThey are not for themselves; they are neutral, indifferent, in\nsuspense as to all things, even themselves being no exception.What then shall man do in this state? Shall he doubt everything?\nShall he doubt whether he is awake, whether he is being\npinched, or whether he is being burned? Shall he doubt whether\nhe doubts? Shall he doubt whether he exists? We cannot go so\nfar as that; and I lay it down as a fact that there never has been\na real complete sceptic. Nature sustains our feeble reason, and\nprevents it raving to this extent.[Pg 121]Shall he then say, on the contrary, that he certainly possesses\ntruth—he who, when pressed ever so little, can show no title to\nit, and is forced to let go his hold?What a chimera then is man! What a novelty! What a\nmonster, what a chaos, what a contradiction, what a prodigy!\nJudge of all things, imbecile worm of the earth; depositary of\ntruth, a sink of uncertainty and error; the pride and refuse of\nthe universe!Who will unravel this tangle? Nature confutes the sceptics,\nand reason confutes the dogmatists. What then will you\nbecome, O men! who try to find out by your natural reason what\nis your true condition? You cannot avoid one of these sects, nor\nadhere to one of them.Know then, proud man, what a paradox you are to yourself.\nHumble yourself, weak reason; be silent, foolish nature; learn\nthat man infinitely transcends man, and learn from your Master\nyour true condition, of which you are ignorant. Hear God.For in fact, if man had never been corrupt, he would enjoy\nin his innocence both truth and happiness with assurance; and\nif man had always been corrupt, he would have no idea of truth\nor bliss. But, wretched as we are, and more so than if there\nwere no greatness in our condition, we have an idea of happiness,\nand cannot reach it. We perceive an image of truth, and possess\nonly a lie. Incapable of absolute ignorance and of certain\nknowledge, we have thus been manifestly in a degree of perfection\nfrom which we have unhappily fallen.It is, however, an astonishing thing that the mystery furthest\nremoved from our knowledge, namely, that of the transmission\nof sin, should be a fact without which we can have no knowledge\nof ourselves. For it is beyond doubt that there is nothing which\nmore shocks our reason than to say that the sin of the first man\nhas rendered guilty those, who, being so removed from this source,\nseem incapable of participation in it. This transmission does\nnot only seem to us impossible, it seems also very unjust. For\nwhat is more contrary to the rules of our miserable justice than\nto damn eternally an infant incapable of will, for a sin wherein\nhe seems to have so little a share, that it was committed six\nthousand years before he was in existence? Certainly nothing\noffends us more rudely than this doctrine; and yet, without\nthis mystery, the most incomprehensible of all, we are incomprehensible\nto ourselves. The knot of our condition takes\nits twists and turns in this abyss, so that man is more[Pg 122]inconceivable without this mystery than this mystery is\ninconceivable to man.[Whence it seems that God, willing to render the difficulty\nof our existence unintelligible to ourselves, has concealed the\nknot so high, or, better speaking, so low, that we are quite\nincapable of reaching it; so that it is not by the proud exertions\nof our reason, but by the simple submissions of reason, that we\ncan truly know ourselves.These foundations, solidly established on the inviolable\nauthority of religion, make us know that there are two truths of\nfaith equally certain: the one, that man, in the state of creation,\nor in that of grace, is raised above all nature, made like unto\nGod and sharing in His divinity; the other, that in the state\nof corruption and sin, he is fallen from this state and made like\nunto the beasts.These two propositions are equally sound and certain. Scripture\nmanifestly declares this to us, when it says in some places:Deliciæ meæ esse cum filiis hominum.[162]Effundam spiritum\nmeum super omnem carnem.[163]Dii estis[164], etc.; and in other\nplaces,Omnis caro fænum.[165]Homo assimilatus est jumentis\ninsipientibus, et similis factus est illis.[166]Dixi in corde meo de\nfiliis hominum.Eccles. iii.Whence it clearly seems that man by grace is made like unto\nGod, and a partaker in His divinity, and that without grace he\nis like unto the brute beasts.]"

Moses Haddarschan: This evil leaven is placed in man\nfrom the time that he is formed.Massechet Succa: This evil leaven has seven names in Scripture.\nIt is calledevil, the foreskin, uncleanness, an enemy, a\nscandal, a heart of stone, the north wind; all this signifies the\nmalignity which is concealed and impressed in the heart of man.Midrasch Tillimsays the same thing, and that God will\ndeliver the good nature of man from the evil.This malignity is renewed every day against man, as it is\nwritten, Psalm xxxvii, 32: \"The wicked watcheth the righteous,\nand seeketh to slay him\"; but God will not abandon him. This\nmalignity tries the heart of man in this life, and will accuse\nhim in the other. All this is found in the Talmud.Midrasch Tillimon Psalm iv, 4: \"Stand in awe and sin not.\"\nStand in awe and be afraid of your lust, and it will not lead you\ninto sin. And on Psalm xxxvi, 1: \"The wicked has said within\nhis own heart, Let not the fear of God be before me.\" That is\nto say that the malignity natural to man has said that to the\nwicked.Midrasch el Kohelet: \"Better is a poor and wise child than an\nold and foolish king who cannot foresee the future.\"[169]The child\nis virtue, and the king is the malignity of man. It is called\nking because all the members obey it, and old because it is in\nthe human heart from infancy to old age, and foolish because\nit leads man in the way of [perdition], which he does not foresee.\nThe same thing is inMidrasch Tillim.Bereschist Rabbaon Psalm xxxv, 10: \"Lord, all my bones\nshall bless Thee, which deliverest the poor from the tyrant.\"\nAnd is there a greater tyrant than the evil leaven? And on\nProverbs xxv, 21: \"If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread\nto eat.\" That is to say, if the evil leaven hunger, give him the\nbread of wisdom of which it is spoken in Proverbs ix., and if he\nbe thirsty, give him the water of which it is spoken in Isaiah lv.Midrasch Tillimsays the same thing, and that Scripture in\nthat passage, speaking of the enemy, means the evil leaven;\nand that, in [giving] him that bread and that water, we heap\ncoals of fire on his head.[Pg 126]Midrasch el Koheleton Ecclesiastes ix, 14: \"A great king\nbesieged a little city.\" This great king is the evil leaven; the\ngreat bulwarks built against it are temptations; and there has\nbeen found a poor wise man who has delivered it—that is to\nsay, virtue.And on Psalm xli, 1: \"Blessed is he that considereth the poor.\"And on Psalm lxxviii, 39: \"The spirit passeth away, and\ncometh not again\"; whence some have erroneously argued\nagainst the immortality of the soul. But the sense is that this\nspirit is the evil leaven, which accompanies man till death, and\nwill not return at the resurrection.And on Psalm ciii the same thing.And on Psalm xvi.Principles of Rabbinism: two Messiahs."

They have seen by the light of nature that if\nthere be a true religion on earth, the course of all things must\ntend to it as to a centre.The whole course of things must have for its object the\nestablishment and the greatness of religion. Men must have\nwithin them feelings suited to what religion teaches us. And,\nfinally, religion must so be the object and centre to which all\nthings tend, that whoever knows the principles of religion can\ngive an explanation both of the whole nature of man in particular,\nand of the whole course of the world in general.And on this ground they take occasion to revile the Christian\nreligion, because they misunderstand it. They imagine that it\nconsists simply in the worship of a God considered as great,\npowerful, and eternal; which is strictly deism, almost as far\nremoved from the Christian religion as atheism, which is its\nexact opposite. And thence they conclude that this religion is\nnot true, because they do not see that all things concur to the\nestablishment of this point, that God does not manifest Himself\nto men with all the evidence which He could show.But let them conclude what they will against deism, they will\nconclude nothing against the Christian religion, which properly\nconsists in the mystery of the Redeemer, who, uniting in Himself\nthe two natures, human and divine, has redeemed men from the[Pg 153]corruption of sin in order to reconcile them in His divine person\nto God.The Christian religion, then, teaches men these two truths;\nthat there is a God whom men can know, and that there is a\ncorruption in their nature which renders them unworthy of Him.\nIt is equally important to men to know both these points; and\nit is equally dangerous for man to know God without knowing\nhis own wretchedness, and to know his own wretchedness without\nknowing the Redeemer who can free him from it. The\nknowledge of only one of these points gives rise either to the\npride of philosophers, who have known God, and not their own\nwretchedness, or to the despair of atheists, who know their own\nwretchedness, but not the Redeemer.And, as it is alike necessary to man to know these two points,\nso is it alike merciful of God to have made us know them. The\nChristian religion does this; it is in this that it consists.Let us herein examine the order of the world, and see if all\nthings do not tend to establish these two chief points of this\nreligion: Jesus Christ is the end of all, and the centre to which\nall tends. Whoever knows Him knows the reason of everything.Those who fall into error err only through failure to see one of\nthese two things. We can then have an excellent knowledge of\nGod without that of our own wretchedness, and of our own\nwretchedness without that of God. But we cannot know Jesus\nChrist without knowing at the same time both God and our own\nwretchedness.Therefore I shall not undertake here to prove by natural\nreasons either the existence of God, or the Trinity, or the immortality\nof the soul, or anything of that nature; not only\nbecause I should not feel myself sufficiently able to find in nature\narguments to convince hardened atheists, but also because such\nknowledge without Jesus Christ is useless and barren. Though\na man should be convinced that numerical proportions are\nimmaterial truths, eternal and dependent on a first truth, in\nwhich they subsist, and which is called God, I should not think\nhim far advanced towards his own salvation.The God of Christians is not a God who is simply the author\nof mathematical truths, or of the order of the elements; that is\nthe view of heathens and Epicureans. He is not merely a God\nwho exercises His providence over the life and fortunes of men,\nto bestow on those who worship Him a long and happy life.\nThat was the portion of the Jews. But the God of Abraham,[Pg 154]the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob, the God of Christians, is a\nGod of love and of comfort, a God who fills the soul and heart of\nthose whom He possesses, a God who makes them conscious of\ntheir inward wretchedness, and His infinite mercy, who unites\nHimself to their inmost soul, who fills it with humility and joy,\nwith confidence and love, who renders them incapable of any\nother end than Himself.All who seek God without Jesus Christ, and who rest in nature,\neither find no light to satisfy them, or come to form for themselves\na means of knowing God and serving Him without a mediator.\nThereby they fall either into atheism, or into deism, two things\nwhich the Christian religion abhors almost equally.Without Jesus Christ the world would not exist; for it should\nneeds be either that it would be destroyed or be a hell.If the world existed to instruct man of God, His divinity\nwould shine through every part in it in an indisputable manner;\nbut as it exists only by Jesus Christ, and for Jesus Christ, and\nto teach men both their corruption and their redemption, all\ndisplays the proofs of these two truths.All appearance indicates neither a total exclusion nor a\nmanifest presence of divinity, but the presence of a God who\nhides Himself. Everything bears this character.... Shall he alone who knows his nature know it only to be\nmiserable? Shall he alone who knows it be alone unhappy?... He must not see nothing at all, nor must he see sufficient\nfor him to believe he possesses it; but he must see enough to\nknow that he has lost it. For to know of his loss, he must see\nand not see; and that is exactly the state in which he naturally is.... Whatever part he takes, I shall not leave him at rest ..."

    "text": "The reason why. Types.—[They had to deal with a carnal\npeople and to render them the depositary of the spiritual\ncovenant.] To give faith to the Messiah, it was necessary there\nshould have been precedent prophecies, and that these should be\nconveyed by persons above suspicion, diligent, faithful, unusually\nzealous, and known to all the world.To accomplish all this, God chose this carnal people, to whom\nHe entrusted the prophecies which foretell the Messiah as a\ndeliverer, and as a dispenser of those carnal goods which this\npeople loved. And thus they have had an extraordinary passion\nfor their prophets, and, in sight of the whole world, have had\ncharge of these books which foretell their Messiah, assuring all\nnations that He should come, and in the way foretold in the\nbooks, which they held open to the whole world. Yet this\npeople, deceived by the poor and ignominious advent of the\nMessiah, have been His most cruel enemies. So that they, the\npeople least open to suspicion in the world of favouring us, the\nmost strict and most zealous that can be named for their law\nand their prophets, have kept the books incorrupt. Hence\nthose who have rejected and crucified Jesus Christ, who has\nbeen to them an offence, are those who have charge of the books\nwhich testify of Him, and state that He will be an offence and\nrejected. Therefore they have shown it was He by rejecting\nHim, and He has been alike proved both by the righteous Jews\nwho received Him, and by the unrighteous who rejected Him,\nboth facts having been foretold.Wherefore the prophecies have a hidden and spiritual meaning,\nto which this people were hostile, under the carnal meaning which\nthey loved. If the spiritual meaning had been revealed, they\nwould not have loved it, and, unable to bear it, they would not\nhave been zealous of the preservation of their books and their[Pg 158]ceremonies; and if they had loved these spiritual promises, and\nhad preserved them incorrupt till the time of the Messiah, their\ntestimony would have had no force, because they had been his\nfriends.Therefore it was well that the spiritual meaning should be concealed;\nbut, on the other hand, if this meaning had been so hidden\nas not to appear at all, it could not have served as a proof of the\nMessiah. What then was done? In a crowd of passages it has\nbeen hidden under the temporal meaning, and in a few has\nbeen clearly revealed; besides that the time and the state of the\nworld have been so clearly foretold that it is clearer than the\nsun. And in some places this spiritual meaning is so clearly\nexpressed, that it would require a blindness like that which the\nflesh imposes on the spirit when it is subdued by it, not to\nrecognise it.See, then, what has been the prudence of God. This meaning\nis concealed under another in an infinite number of passages,\nand in some, though rarely, it is revealed; but yet so that the\npassages in which it is concealed are equivocal, and can suit\nboth meanings; whereas the passages where it is disclosed are\nunequivocal, and can only suit the spiritual meaning.So that this cannot lead us into error, and could only be\nmisunderstood by so carnal a people.For when blessings are promised in abundance, what was\nto prevent them from understanding the true blessings, but\ntheir covetousness, which limited the meaning to worldly goods?\nBut those whose only good was in God referred them to\nGod alone. For there are two principles, which divide the\nwills of men, covetousness and charity. Not that covetousness\ncannot exist along with faith in God, nor charity with worldly\nriches; but covetousness uses God, and enjoys the world, and\ncharity is the opposite.Now the ultimate end gives names to things. All which\nprevents us from attaining it, is called an enemy to us. Thus\nthe creatures, however good, are the enemies of the righteous,\nwhen they turn them away from God, and God Himself is the\nenemy of those whose covetousness He confounds.Thus as the significance of the word \"enemy\" is dependent\non the ultimate end, the righteous understood by it their passions,\nand the carnal the Babylonians; and so these terms were obscure\nonly for the unrighteous. And this is what Isaiah says:Signa\nlegem in electis meis,[208]and that Jesus Christ shall be a stone of[Pg 159]stumbling. But, \"Blessed are they who shall not be offended\nin him.\" Hosea,[209]ult., says excellently, \"Where is the wise?\nand he shall understand what I say. The righteous shall know\nthem, for the ways of God are right; but the transgressors shall\nfall therein.\""

It is certain that we see in many places of the\nworld a peculiar people, separated from all other peoples of the\nworld, and called the Jewish people.I see then a crowd of religions in many parts of the world\nand in all times; but their morality cannot please me, nor can\ntheir proofs convince me. Thus I should equally have rejected\nthe religion of Mahomet and of China, of the ancient Romans\nand of the Egyptians, for the sole reason, that none having more[Pg 173]marks of truth than another, nor anything which should necessarily\npersuade me, reason cannot incline to one rather than the\nother.But, in thus considering this changeable and singular variety\nof morals and beliefs at different times, I find in one corner of\nthe world a peculiar people, separated from all other peoples\non earth, the most ancient of all, and whose histories are earlier\nby many generations than the most ancient which we possess.I find, then, this great and numerous people, sprung from a\nsingle man, who worship one God, and guide themselves by a\nlaw which they say that they obtained from His own hand.\nThey maintain that they are the only people in the world to\nwhom God has revealed His mysteries; that all men are corrupt\nand in disgrace with God; that they are all abandoned to their\nsenses and their own imagination, whence come the strange\nerrors and continual changes which happen among them, both\nof religions and of morals, whereas they themselves remain\nfirm in their conduct; but that God will not leave other nations\nin this darkness for ever; that there will come a Saviour for all;\nthat they are in the world to announce Him to men; that they\nare expressly formed to be forerunners and heralds of this great\nevent, and to summon all nations to join with them in the\nexpectation of this Saviour.To meet with this people is astonishing to me, and seems to\nme worthy of attention. I look at the law which they boast of\nhaving obtained from God, and I find it admirable. It is the\nfirst law of all, and is of such a kind that, even before the termlawwas in currency among the Greeks, it had, for nearly a\nthousand years earlier, been uninterruptedly accepted and\nobserved by the Jews. I likewise think it strange that the\nfirst law of the world happens to be the most perfect; so that the\ngreatest legislators have borrowed their laws from it, as is\napparent from the law of the Twelve Tables at Athens,[221]afterwards\ntaken by the Romans, and as it would be easy to prove,\nif Josephus[222]and others had not sufficiently dealt with this\nsubject."

This is unique.This family, or people, is the most ancient within human\nknowledge, a fact which seems to me to inspire a peculiar\nveneration for it, especially in view of our present inquiry;\nsince if God had from all time revealed Himself to men, it is to\nthese we must turn for knowledge of the tradition.This people is not eminent solely by their antiquity, but is\nalso singular by their duration, which has always continued\nfrom their origin till now. For whereas the nations of Greece\nand of Italy, of Lacedæmon, of Athens and of Rome, and others\nwho came long after, have long since perished, these ever remain,\nand in spite of the endeavours of many powerful kings who have\na hundred times tried to destroy them, as their historians testify,\nand as it is easy to conjecture from the natural order of things\nduring so long a space of years, they have nevertheless been\npreserved (and this preservation has been foretold); and\nextending from the earliest times to the latest, their history\ncomprehends in its duration all our histories [which it preceded\nby a long time].The law by which this people is governed is at once the most\nancient law in the world, the most perfect, and the only one\nwhich has been always observed without a break in a state.\nThis is what Josephus admirably proves,against Apion,[223]and\nalso Philo[224]the Jew, in different places, where they point out that\nit is so ancient that the very name oflawwas only known by the\noldest nation more than a thousand years afterwards; so that\nHomer, who has written the history of so many states, has\nnever used the term. And it is easy to judge of its perfection\nby simply reading it; for we see that it has provided for all\nthings with so great wisdom, equity, and judgment, that the\nmost ancient legislators, Greek and Roman, having had some\nknowledge of it, have borrowed from it their principal laws;\nthis is evident from what are called the Twelve Tables, and from\nthe other proofs which Josephus gives.But this law is at the same time the severest and strictest of\nall in respect to their religious worship, imposing on this people,\nin order to keep them to their duty, a thousand peculiar and\npainful observances, on pain of death. Whence it is very[Pg 175]astonishing that it has been constantly preserved during many\ncenturies by a people, rebellious and impatient as this one\nwas; while all other states have changed their laws from time\nto time, although these were far more lenient.The book which contains this law, the first of all, is itself the\nmost ancient book in the world, those of Homer, Hesiod, and\nothers, being six or seven hundred years later."

We cannot even reconcile the passages of the\nsame author, nor of the same book, nor sometimes of the same\nchapter, which indicates copiously what was the meaning of\nthe author. As when Ezekiel, chap, xx, says that man will\nnot live by the commandments of God and will live by them."

No. Do they\nthen indicate what is typical? No, but what is either real or\ntypical. But the first passages, excluding as they do reality,\nindicate that all this is only typical.All these passages together cannot be applied to reality; all\ncan be said to be typical; therefore they are not spoken of reality,\nbut of the type.Agnus occisus est ab origine mundi.[262]A sacrificing judge."

But there is\na God in heaven who can do so, and that hath revealed to thee\nin thy dream what shall be in the latter days,\" (This dream\nmust have caused him much misgiving.)\"And it is not by my own wisdom that I have knowledge of\nthis secret, but by the revelation of this same God, that hath\nrevealed it to me, to make it manifest in thy presence.\"Thy dream was then of this kind. Thou sawest a great\nimage, high and terrible, which stood before thee. His head\nwas of gold, his breast and arms of silver, his belly and his thighs\nof brass, his legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.\nThus thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands,\nwhich smote the image upon his feet, that were of iron and of\nclay, and brake them to pieces.\"Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the\ngold broken to pieces together, and the wind carried them\naway; but this stone that smote the image became a great\nmountain, and filled the whole earth. This is the dream, and\nnow I will give thee the interpretation thereof.\"Thou who art the greatest of kings, and to whom God\nhath given a power so vast that thou art renowned among all\npeoples, art the head of gold which thou hast seen. But after\nthee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another\nthird kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.\"But the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron, and even as\niron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things, so shall this\nempire break in pieces and bruise all.\"And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of clay\nand part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall\nbe in it of the strength of iron and of the weakness of clay.\"But as iron cannot be firmly mixed with clay, so they who[Pg 210]are represented by the iron and by the clay, shall not cleave\none to another though united by marriage.\"Now in the days of these kings shall God set up a kingdom,\nwhich shall never be destroyed, nor ever be delivered up to other\npeople. It shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms,\nand it shall stand for ever, according as thou sawest that the\nstone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that\nit fell from the mountain, and brake in pieces the iron, the\nclay, the silver, and the gold. God hath made known to thee\nwhat shall come to pass hereafter. This dream is certain, and\nthe interpretation thereof sure.\"Then Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face towards the\nearth,\" etc.Daniel viii, 8. \"Daniel having seen the combat of the ram\nand of the he-goat, who vanquished him and ruled over the\nearth, whereof the principal horn being broken four others came\nup toward the four winds of heaven, and out of one of them\ncame forth a little horn, which waxed exceedingly great toward\nthe south, and toward the east, and toward the land of Israel,\nand it waxed great even to the host of heaven; and it cast down\nsome of the stars, and stamped upon them, and at last overthrew\nthe prince, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away,\nand the place of his sanctuary was cast down.\"This is what Daniel saw. He sought the meaning of it, and\na voice cried in this manner, 'Gabriel, make this man to understand\nthe vision,' And Gabriel said:\"The ram which thou sawest is the king of the Medes and\nPersians, and the he-goat is the king of Greece, and the great\nhorn that is between his eyes is the first king of this monarchy.\"Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four\nkingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.\"And in the latter time of their kingdom, when iniquities\nare come to the full, there shall arise a king, insolent and strong,\nbut not by his own power, to whom all things shall succeed after\nhis own will; and he shall destroy the holy people, and through\nhis policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand, and\nhe shall destroy many. He shall also stand up against the\nPrince of princes, but he shall perish miserably, and nevertheless\nby a violent hand.\"Daniel ix, 20. \"Whilst I was praying with all my heart, and\nconfessing my sin and the sin of all my people, and prostrating\nmyself before my God, even Gabriel, whom I had seen in the[Pg 211]vision at the beginning, came to me and touched me about the\ntime of the evening oblation, and he informed me and said, O\nDaniel, I am now come forth to give thee the knowledge of\nthings. At the beginning of thy supplications I came to shew\nthat which thou didst desire, for thou are greatly beloved:\ntherefore understand the matter, and consider the vision.\nSeventy weeks are determined upon thy people, and upon thy\nholy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins,\nand to abolish iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness;\nto accomplish the vision and the prophecies, and to anoint the\nMost Holy. (After which this people shall be no more thy\npeople, nor this city the holy city. The times of wrath shall be\npassed, and the years of grace shall come for ever.)\"Know therefore, and understand, that, from the going forth\nof the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the\nMessiah the Prince, shall be seven weeks, and three score and\ntwo weeks.\" (The Hebrews were accustomed to divide numbers,\nand to place the small first. Thus, 7 and 62 make 69. Of this\n70 there will then remain the 70th, that is to say, the 7 last\nyears of which he will speak next.)\"The street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous\ntimes. And after three score and two weeks,\" (which have\nfollowed the first seven. Christ will then be killed after the\nsixty-nine weeks, that is to say, in the last week), \"the Christ\nshall be cut off, and a people of the prince that shall come shall\ndestroy the city and the sanctuary, and overwhelm all, and the\nend of that war shall accomplish the desolation.\"\"Now one week,\" (which is the seventieth, which remains),\n\"shall confirm the covenant with many, and in the midst of the\nweek,\" (that is to say, the last three and a half years), \"he shall\ncause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading\nof abominations he shall make it desolate, even until\nthe consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon\nthe desolate.\"Daniel xi. \"The angel said to Daniel: There shall stand up\nyet,\" (after Cyrus, under whom this still is), \"three kings in\nPersia,\" (Cambyses, Smerdis, Darius); \"and the fourth who\nshall then come,\" (Xerxes) \"shall be far richer than they all,\nand far stronger, and shall stir up all his people against the\nGreeks.\"But a mighty king shall stand up,\" (Alexander), \"that shall\nrule with great dominion, and do according to his will. And[Pg 212]when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall\nbe divided in four parts toward the four winds of heaven,\" (as\nhe had said above, vii, 6; viii, 8), \"but not his posterity; and his\nsuccessors shall not equal his power, for his kingdom shall be\nplucked up, even for others besides these,\" (his four chief\nsuccessors).\"And the king of the south,\" (Ptolemy, son of Lagos, Egypt),\n\"shall be strong; but one of his princes shall be strong above\nhim, and his dominion shall be a great dominion,\" (Seleucus,\nKing of Syria. Appian says that he was the most powerful of\nAlexander's successors).\"And in the end of years they shall join themselves together,\nand the king's daughter of the south,\" (Berenice, daughter of\nPtolemy Philadelphus, son of the other Ptolemy), \"shall come\nto the king of the north,\" (to Antiochus Deus, King of Syria\nand of Asia, son of Seleucus Lagidas), \"to make peace between\nthese princes.\"But neither she nor her seed shall have a long authority;\nfor she and they that brought her, and her children, and her\nfriends, shall be delivered to death.\" (Berenice and her son\nwere killed by Seleucus Callinicus.)\"But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up,\"\n(Ptolemy Euergetes was the issue of the same father as Berenice),\n\"which shall come with a mighty army into the land of the\nking of the north, where he shall put all under subjection, and\nhe shall also carry captive into Egypt their gods, their princes,\ntheir gold, their silver, and all their precious spoils,\" (if he had\nnot been called into Egypt by domestic reasons, says Justin,\nhe would have entirely stripped Seleucus); \"and he shall continue\nseveral years when the king of the north can do nought\nagainst him.\"And so he shall return into his kingdom. But his sons\nshall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great\nforces,\" (Seleucus Ceraunus, Antiochus the Great). \"And\ntheir army shall come and overthrow all; wherefore the king of\nthe south shall be moved with choler, and shall also form a great\narmy, and fight him,\" (Ptolemy Philopator against Antiochus\nthe Great at Raphia), \"and conquer; and his troops shall become\ninsolent, and his heart shall be lifted up,\" (this Ptolemy desecrated\nthe temple; Josephus): \"he shall cast down many ten\nthousands, but he shall not be strengthened by it. For the\nking of the north,\" (Antiochus the Great), \"shall return with a[Pg 213]greater multitude than before, and in those times also a great\nnumber of enemies shall stand up against the king of the south,\"\n(during the reign of the young Ptolemy Epiphanes); \"also the\napostates and robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to\nestablish the vision; but they shall fall.\" (Those who abandon\ntheir religion to please Euergetes, when he will send his troops\nto Scopas; for Antiochus will again take Scopas, and conquer\nthem.) \"And the king of the north shall destroy the fenced cities,\nand the arms of the south shall not withstand, and all shall yield\nto his will; he shall stand in the land of Israel, and it shall yield\nto him. And thus he shall think to make himself master of all\nthe empire of Egypt,\" (despising the youth of Epiphanes, says\nJustin). \"And for that he shall make alliance with him, and\ngive his daughter\" (Cleopatra, in order that she may betray\nher husband. On which Appian says that doubting his ability\nto make himself master of Egypt by force, because of the protection\nof the Romans, he wished to attempt it by cunning).\n\"He shall wish to corrupt her, but she shall not stand on his\nside, neither be for him. Then he shall turn his face to other\ndesigns, and shall think to make himself master of some isles,\"\n(that is to say, seaports), \"and shall take many,\" (as Appian\nsays).\"But a prince shall oppose his conquests,\" (Scipio Africanus,\nwho stopped the progress of Antiochus the Great, because he\noffended the Romans in the person of their allies), \"and shall\ncause the reproach offered by him to cease. He shall then\nreturn into his kingdom and there perish, and be no more.\"\n(He was slain by his soldiers.)\"And he who shall stand up in his estate,\" (Seleucus Philopator\nor Soter, the son of Antiochus the Great), \"shall be a tyrant, a\nraiser of taxes in the glory of the kingdom,\" (which means the\npeople), \"but within a few days he shall be destroyed, neither\nin anger nor in battle. And in his place shall stand up a vile\nperson, unworthy of the honour of the kingdom, but he shall\ncome in cleverly by flatteries. All armies shall bend before\nhim; he shall conquer them, and even the prince with whom\nhe has made a covenant. For having renewed the league with\nhim, he shall work deceitfully, and enter with a small people\ninto his province, peaceably and without fear. He shall take\nthe fattest places, and shall do that which his fathers have not\ndone, and ravage on all sides. He shall forecast great devices\nduring his time.\"[Pg 214]"

For two thousand\nyears no heathen had worshipped the God of the Jews; and at\nthe time foretold, a great number of the heathen worshipped\nthis only God. The temples were destroyed. The very kings\nmade submission to the cross. All this was due to the Spirit\nof God, which was spread abroad upon the earth.No heathen, since Moses until Jesus Christ, believed according\nto the very Rabbis.

These are\nthree orders differing in kind.Great geniuses have their power, their glory, their greatness,\ntheir victory, their lustre, and have no need of worldly greatness,\nwith which they are not in keeping. They are seen, not by the\neye, but by the mind; this is sufficient.The saints have their power, their glory, their victory, their\nlustre, and need no worldly or intellectual greatness, with which\nthey have no affinity; for these neither add anything to them,\nnor take away anything from them. They are seen of God\nand the angels, and not of the body, nor of the curious mind.\nGod is enough for them.Archimedes,[316]apart from his rank, would have the same\nveneration. He fought no battles for the eyes to feast upon;\nbut he has given his discoveries to all men. Oh! how brilliant\nhe was to the mind!Jesus Christ, without riches, and without any external\nexhibition of knowledge, is in His own order of holiness. He\ndid not invent; He did not reign. But He was humble, patient,\nholy, holy to God, terrible to devils, without any sin. Oh! in\nwhat great pomp, and in what wonderful splendour, He is come\nto the eyes of the heart, which perceive wisdom!It would have been useless for Archimedes to have acted\nthe prince in his books on geometry, although he was a\nprince.It would have been useless for our Lord Jesus Christ to[Pg 235]come like a king, in order to shine forth in His kingdom of\nholiness. But He came there appropriately in the glory of His\nown order.It is most absurd to take offence at the lowliness of Jesus\nChrist, as if His lowliness were in the same order as the greatness\nwhich He came to manifest. If we consider this greatness in\nHis life, in His passion, in His obscurity, in His death, in the\nchoice of His disciples, in their desertion, in His secret resurrection,\nand the rest, we shall see it to be so immense, that we\nshall have no reason for being offended at a lowliness which is\nnot of that order.But there are some who can only admire worldly greatness,\nas though there were no intellectual greatness; and others who\nonly admire intellectual greatness, as though there were not\ninfinitely higher things in wisdom.All bodies, the firmament, the stars, the earth and its kingdoms,\nare not equal to the lowest mind; for mind knows all\nthese and itself; and these bodies nothing.All bodies together, and all minds together, and all their\nproducts, are not equal to the least feeling of charity. This\nis of an order infinitely more exalted.From all bodies together, we cannot obtain one little thought;\nthis is impossible, and of another order. From all bodies and\nminds, we cannot produce a feeling of true charity; this is\nimpossible, and of another and supernatural order."

For it would not be possible that\nthere should be so many false remedies, and that so much faith\nshould be placed in them, if there were none true. If there\nhad never been any remedy for any ill, and all ills had been\nincurable, it is impossible that men should have imagined that\nthey could give remedies, and still more impossible that so many\nothers should have believed those who boasted of having\nremedies; in the same way as did a man boast of preventing[Pg 241]death, no one would believe him, because there is no example of\nthis. But as there were a number of remedies found to be true\nby the very knowledge of the greatest men, the belief of men is\nthereby induced; and, this being known to be possible, it has\nbeen therefore concluded that it was. For people commonly\nreason thus: \"A thing is possible, therefore it is\"; because the\nthing cannot be denied generally, since there are particular\neffects which are true, the people, who cannot distinguish which\namong these particular effects are true, believe them all. In\nthe same way, the reason why so many false effects are credited\nto the moon, is that there are some true, as the tide.It is the same with prophecies, miracles, divination by dreams,\nsorceries, etc. For if there had been nothing true in all this,\nmen would have believed nothing of them; and thus, instead\nof concluding that there are no true miracles because there are\nso many false, we must, on the contrary, say that there certainly\nare true miracles, since there are false, and that there are false\nmiracles only because some are true. We must reason in the\nsame way about religion; for it would not be possible that men\nshould have imagined so many false religions, if there had not\nbeen a true one. The objection to this is that savages have a\nreligion; but the answer is that they have heard the true spoken\nof, as appears by the deluge, circumcision, the cross of Saint\nAndrew, etc."

Room\nis opened for blasphemy, even against the truths that are at\nleast very likely. If the truths of the Gospel are published, the\ncontrary is published too, and the questions are obscured, so\nthat the people cannot distinguish. And they ask, \"What\nhave you to make you believed rather than others? What sign\ndo you give? You have only words, and so have we. If you had\nmiracles, good and well.\" That doctrine ought to be supported\nby miracles is a truth, which they misuse in order to revile\ndoctrine. And if miracles happen, it is said that miracles are[Pg 250]not enough without doctrine; and this is another truth, which\nthey misuse in order to revile miracles.Jesus Christ cured the man born blind, and performed a\nnumber of miracles on the Sabbath day. In this way He\nblinded the Pharisees, who said that miracles must be judged\nby doctrine.\"We have Moses: but, as for this fellow, we know not from\nwhence he is.\"[344]It is wonderful that you know not whence He\nis, and yet He does such miracles.Jesus Christ spoke neither against God, nor against Moses.Antichrist and the false prophets, foretold by both Testaments,\nwill speak openly against God and against Jesus Christ. Who\nis not hidden ... God would not allow him, who would be a\nsecret enemy, to do miracles openly.In a public dispute where the two parties profess to be for\nGod, for Jesus Christ, for the Church, miracles have never been\non the side of the false Christians, and the other side has never\nbeen without a miracle.\"He hath a devil.\" John x, 21. And others said, \"Can a\ndevil open the eyes of the blind?\"The proofs which Jesus Christ and the apostles draw from\nScripture are not conclusive; for they say only that Moses\nforetold that a prophet should come. But they do not thereby\nprove that this is He; and that is the whole question. These\npassages therefore serve only to show that they are not contrary\nto Scripture, and that there appears no inconsistency, but not\nthat there is agreement. Now this is enough, namely, exclusion\nof inconsistency, along with miracles.There is a mutual duty between God and men. We must\npardon Him this saying: Quid debui?[345]\"Accuse me,\" said God\nin Isaiah.\"God must fulfil His promises,\" etc.Men owe it to God to accept the religion which He sends.\nGod owes it to men not to lead them into error. Now, they\nwould be led into error, if the workers of miracles announced a\ndoctrine which should not appear evidently false to the light of\ncommon sense, and if a greater worker of miracles had not\nalready warned men not to believe them.Thus, if there were divisions in the Church, and the Arians,\nfor example, who declared themselves founded on Scripture\njust as the Catholics, had done miracles, and not the Catholics,\nmen should have been led into error.[Pg 251]For, as a man, who announces to us the secrets of God, is not\nworthy to be believed on his private authority, and that is why\nthe ungodly doubt him; so when a man, as a token of the communion\nwhich he has with God, raises the dead, foretells the\nfuture, removes the seas, heals the sick, there is none so wicked\nas not to bow to him, and the incredulity of Pharaoh and the\nPharisees is the effect of a supernatural obduracy.When, therefore, we see miracles and a doctrine not suspicious,\nboth on one side, there is no difficulty. But when we see miracles\nand suspicious doctrine on the same side, we must then see which\nis the clearest. Jesus Christ was suspected.Bar-jesus blinded.[346]The power of God surpasses that of His\nenemies.The Jewish exorcists[347]beaten by the devils, saying, \"Jesus I\nknow, and Paul I know; but who are ye?\"Miracles are for doctrine, and not doctrine for miracles.If the miracles are true, shall we be able to persuade men\nof all doctrine? No; for this will not come to pass.Si\nangelus.[348]...Rule: we must judge of doctrine by miracles; we must judge\nof miracles by doctrine. All this is true, but contains no\ncontradiction.For we must distinguish the times.How glad you are to know the general rules, thinking thereby\nto set up dissension, and render all useless! We shall prevent\nyou, my father; truth is one and constant.It is impossible, from the duty of God to men, that a man,\nhiding his evil teaching, and only showing the good, saying\nthat he conforms to God and the Church, should do miracles\nso as to instil insensibly a false and subtle doctrine. This\ncannot happen.And still less, that God, who knows the heart, should perform\nmiracles in favour of such a one."

And if she suffer\nmore because of the multiplicity of errors, she derives this\nadvantage from it, that they destroy each other.She complains of both, but far more of the Calvinists, because\nof the schism.[Pg 258]It is certain that many of the two opposite sects are deceived.\nThey must be disillusioned.Faith embraces many truths which seem to contradict each\nother.There is a time to laugh, and a time to weep,[360]etc.Responde.\nNe respondeas,[361]etc.The source of this is the union of the two natures in Jesus\nChrist; and also the two worlds (the creation of a new heaven\nand a new earth; a new life and a new death; all things double,\nand the same names remaining); and finally the two natures\nthat are in the righteous, (for they are the two worlds, and a\nmember and image of Jesus Christ. And thus all the names\nsuit them: righteous, yet sinners; dead, yet living; living, yet\ndead; elect, yet outcast, etc.).There are then a great number of truths, both of faith and of\nmorality, which seem contradictory, and which all hold good\ntogether in a wonderful system. The source of all heresies is\nthe exclusion of some of these truths; and the source of all the\nobjections which the heretics make against us is the ignorance\nof some of our truths. And it generally happens that, unable\nto conceive the connection of two opposite truths, and believing\nthat the admission of one involves the exclusion of the other,\nthey adhere to the one, exclude the other, and think of us as\nopposed to them. Now exclusion is the cause of their heresy;\nand ignorance that we hold the other truth causes their objections.1st example: Jesus Christ is God and man. The Arians,\nunable to reconcile these things, which they believe incompatible,\nsay that He is man; in this they are Catholics. But they deny\nthat He is God; in this they are heretics. They allege that we\ndeny His humanity; in this they are ignorant.2nd example: On the subject of the Holy Sacrament. We\nbelieve that, the substance of the bread being changed, and\nbeing consubstantial with that of the body of our Lord, Jesus\nChrist is therein really present. That is one truth. Another\nis that this Sacrament is also a type of the cross and of glory,\nand a commemoration of the two. That is the Catholic faith,\nwhich comprehends these two truths which seem opposed.The heresy of to-day, not conceiving that this Sacrament\ncontains at the same time both the presence of Jesus Christ\nand a type of Him, and that it is a sacrifice and a commemoration\nof a sacrifice, believes that neither of these truths can be admitted\nwithout excluding the other for this reason.They fasten to this point alone, that this Sacrament is typical;[Pg 259]and in this they are not heretics. They think that we exclude\nthis truth; hence it comes that they raise so many objections to\nus out of the passages of the Fathers which assert it. Finally,\nthey deny the presence; and in this they are heretics.3rd example: Indulgences.The shortest way, therefore, to prevent heresies is to instruct\nin all truths; and the surest way to refute them is to declare\nthem all.

So that if it is true, on the one hand, that some lax\nmonks, and some corrupt casuists, who are not members of\nthe hierarchy, are steeped in these corruptions, it is, on the\nother hand, certain that the true pastors of the Church, who\nare the true guardians of the Divine Word, have preserved it\nunchangeably against the efforts of those who have attempted\nto destroy it.And thus true believers have no pretext to follow that laxity,\nwhich is only offered to them by the strange hands of these\ncasuists, instead of the sound doctrine which is presented to them\nby the fatherly hands of their own pastors. And the ungodly\nand heretics have no ground for publishing these abuses as\nevidence of imperfection in the providence of God over His\nChurch; since, the Church consisting properly in the body of\nthe hierarchy, we are so far from being able to conclude from\nthe present state of matters that God has abandoned her to\ncorruption, that it has never been more apparent than at the\npresent time that God visibly protects her from corruption.For if some of these men, who, by an extraordinary vocation,\nhave made profession of withdrawing from the world and\nadopting the monks' dress, in order to live in a more perfect\nstate than ordinary Christians, have fallen into excesses which\nhorrify ordinary Christians, and have become to us what the\nfalse prophets were among the Jews; this is a private and personal\nmisfortune, which must indeed be deplored, but from which\nnothing can be inferred against the care which God takes of\nHis Church; since all these things are so clearly foretold, and it\nhas been so long since announced that these temptations would\narise from people of this kind; so that when we are well instructed,\nwe see in this rather evidence of the care of God than\nof His forgetfulness in regard to us.[Pg 265]"
